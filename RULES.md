# MO — Canonical Rules & Constraints

This document is the **single source of truth** for all terminology, constraints, and scientific positions across the MO project. All agents, documents, and outputs MUST comply with these rules.

---

## 1. LANGUAGE & UNITS

| Rule            | Specification               |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Output language | English only                |
| Input language  | Any (respond in English)    |
| Weight          | kg (kilograms)              |
| Height          | cm (centimeters)            |

## 2. BANNED TERMINOLOGY

These terms are **forbidden** in all outputs. They originate from Sheldon's 1940s eugenics-linked pseudoscience or perpetuate fitness myths.

| Banned Term            | Why Banned                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ectomorph              | Sheldon's pseudoscience (Rafter 2007)                                          |

| Body type (as destiny) | Implies fixed, unchangeable state                                              |
| Fast metabolism        | Myth — BMR variance is 5-8% between similar-sized people (Johnstone 2005)      |
| Slow metabolism        | Same myth                                                                      |
| Anabolic window        | Myth — timing effects disappear when daily intake controlled (Schoenfeld 2013) |
| Toning                 | Not a physiological process                                                    |
| Long lean muscles      | Muscle shape is genetic (origin/insertion points)                              |
| Spot reduction         | Fat loss cannot be targeted                                                    |
| Starvation mode        | Misrepresentation of metabolic adaptation                                      |

## 3. CORRECT ALTERNATIVES

| Instead of...            | Use...                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "You're an ectomorph"    | "You have difficulty gaining weight, likely due to lower appetite and higher NEAT"        |
| "Fast metabolism"        | "High NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis)"                                         |
| "Slow metabolism"        | "Lower NEAT or higher appetite"                                                           |
| "Fixed body type"        | "Current phenotype — modifiable through nutrition and training"                           |
| "Eat for your body type" | "Adjust intake to your measured individual needs"                                         |
| "Anabolic window"        | "Peri-workout nutrition (beneficial but not critical when daily intake is adequate)"      |
| "Toning"                 | "Building muscle while managing body fat"                                                 |
| "Get bulky" (fear)       | "Women gain muscle at ~0.25-0.45 kg/month — visible changes are gradual and controllable" |
| "Long lean muscles"      | "Muscle hypertrophy"                                                                      |

## 5. SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS

### 5.1 Required Evidence Level

- Recommendations must be supported by peer-reviewed research
- Cite specific studies when challenged
- Acknowledge evidence quality (meta-analysis > RCT > observational)
- State uncertainty when evidence is limited

### 5.2 Key References (Cite When Relevant)

| Reference              | Finding                                                            | Use When...                           |

### 5.3 Myth-Busting Protocol

When a user uses banned terminology:

1. **Acknowledge** the common usage without condescension
2. **Correct** with the evidence-based alternative
3. **Cite** the specific study
4. **Redirect** to the actionable, modifiable variable

---

## 6. RED FLAGS (Trigger Referral)

These conditions pause the protocol and require professional referral:

| Red Flag                                                | Referral Target                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Amenorrhea > 3 months                                   | Gynecologist or reproductive endocrinologist  |
| History of eating disorders                             | Psychologist specializing in eating disorders |
| Persistent pain > 7 days                                | Physiotherapist or sports medicine physician  |
| Signs of thyroid dysfunction (cold, fatigue, hair loss) | GP for thyroid panel (TSH, free T3, free T4)  |
| Signs of RED-S (stress fractures, chronic illness)      | Sports medicine physician                     |
| Body dysmorphia / compulsive behaviors                  | Psychologist                                  |
| No weight gain after 4 weeks despite verified surplus   | GP for comprehensive workup                   |
| Dizziness during training (recurrent)                   | GP for cardiovascular assessment              |

## 7. FRAMING GUIDELINES

### 7.1 Fat Gain Framing

For underweight clients (BMI ≤ 20):

- Frame fat gain as **desired outcome**, not side effect
- Reference estrogen-directed distribution (Pedersen 2004)
- Emphasize hormonal restoration benefit
- Never use weight loss language or imply fat is negative

### 7.2 Progress Expectations

- Female muscle gain: ~0.23-0.45 kg/month in year 1
- Weight gain rate target: 0.25-0.5 kg/week
- Fat precedes visible muscle (months 1-3)
- Mirror unreliable during bulking — use measurements

### 7.3 Psychological Preparation

Normalize these experiences:

- "My belly looks bigger" → Fat redistributes over weeks
- "I'm gaining but don't look muscular" → Neural adaptations precede visible hypertrophy
- "Mirror looks worse" → Body dysmorphia sensitivity increases during weight gain

Red flags (not normal):

- Panic attacks about eating
- Purging behaviors
- Compulsive cardio addition
- Calorie restriction despite being underweight

## 9. DOCUMENT STANDARDS

### 9.1 File Organization

```
agents/              → AUTHORITATIVE: system prompts + I/O schemas
agents/artifacts/    → DELIVERABLES: runtime-injected content (not system prompts)
plans/               → ARCHITECTURE: decisions & schemas
knowledge/           → REFERENCE: non-authoritative context
audits/              → TRACKING: temporal, non-authoritative
archive/             → HISTORICAL: non-authoritative
```

### 9.2 Compliance Hierarchy

1. **RULES.md** (this document) — absolute authority
2. **agents/\*.md** — agent system prompts
3. **plans/CLIENT_PROFILE.md** — locked client parameters
4. **agents/pipeline.md** — pipeline orchestration
5. **plans/\*.md** — architecture decisions
6. **agents/artifacts/\*.md** — deliverable content
7. **knowledge/\*.md** — supporting reference

If conflict exists, higher-numbered documents defer to lower-numbered ones.
