## Protein Batch Techniques

### Chicken Thighs (Skin-On, Bone-In)

**Why thighs**: Stay moist 4 days. More calorie-dense than breast. Forgiving on reheating.

**Batch quantity**: 800g (Batch A), 600g (Batch B) = ~1.4 kg/week

**Method**:
1. Pat dry with paper towels
2. Season: salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika
3. Arrange skin-up on sheet pan (don't crowd)
4. Roast 200°C for 40-45 minutes (internal 74°C)
5. Rest 10 minutes before slicing
6. Store with juices poured over

**Reheating**: Microwave 2 min with 1 tbsp broth/water, covered. Or oven 150°C 10 min.

### Ground Beef (80/20)

**Why 80/20**: Fat content prevents dryness. More calories. Better flavor.

**Batch quantity**: 500g (Batch A), 400g (Batch B) = ~900g/week

**Method**:
1. Large pan, medium-high heat
2. Add beef, break into chunks
3. Season: salt, pepper, onion powder
4. Cook 8-10 minutes until browned
5. Drain excess fat only if pooling (keep some for moisture)
6. Portion immediately while warm

**Reheating**: Stovetop with lid + splash of water. Or microwave 90 sec covered.

### Salmon Fillets

**Why salmon**: Stays tender when cold. High omega-3. Premium protein.

**Batch quantity**: 400g (once per week, usually Wednesday fresh cook)

**Method**:
1. Pat dry, season: salt, pepper, lemon zest
2. Oven 200°C on parchment-lined sheet
3. Roast 12-15 minutes (flakes easily)
4. Optional: glaze with teriyaki last 3 minutes

**Storage note**: Salmon best eaten within 3 days. Cook Wednesday, consume Wed-Fri.

**Reheating**: Oven 150°C for 8 minutes. Microwave makes it rubbery — avoid.

## Carb Batch Techniques

### Rice (Jasmine or Basmati)

**Batch quantity**: 500g dry (Batch A) + 400g dry (Batch B) = ~900g dry/week

**Method**:
1. Rinse until water runs clear
2. Rice cooker: 1:1.25 water ratio
3. Fluff with fork when done
4. Cool 10 minutes before portioning
5. Store in shallow containers (prevents clumping)

**Reheating**: Microwave with 1-2 tbsp water, covered, 2 minutes. Stir halfway.

### Pasta

**Batch quantity**: 300-400g dry per session when needed

**Method**:
1. Cook 1 minute less than package directions (al dente)
2. Drain, toss with 1 tbsp olive oil immediately
3. Cool before storing
4. Portion with protein and sauce

**Reheating**: 30-second boil in hot water. Or microwave with sauce.

### Potatoes / Sweet Potatoes

**Batch quantity**: 500g per session when on menu

**Method**:
1. Cube into 2cm pieces
2. Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary
3. Roast 200°C for 30-35 minutes, turning once
4. Cool and portion

**Reheating**: Oven 180°C 10 min for crispness. Microwave acceptable.

## Sauce Rotation System

### The Principle

Same protein + different sauce = completely different meal.

Prep 2 sauces per batch session. Rotate through 6-8 sauces over 4 weeks.

### Sauce Storage

- Mason jars (250ml)
- Fridge life: 7 days
- Label with name + date
- Bring to room temp before serving (or quick microwave)
