## Calorie Boosters (Add-ons)

If shake needs more calories:

| Add-on              | Amount   | Adds      |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Extra olive oil     | 1 tbsp   | +120 kcal |
| Coconut cream       | 2 tbsp   | +60 kcal  |
| Extra oats          | 20g      | +76 kcal  |
| MCT oil             | 1 tbsp   | +115 kcal |
| Extra banana        | 1 medium | +105 kcal |
| Dried fruit (dates) | 2        | +133 kcal |
| Hemp seeds          | 1 tbsp   | +55 kcal  |

---

## Equipment Notes

**Required**: High-speed blender (Vitamix, Ninja, Nutribullet 900W+)

Standard blenders may not fully break down oats and dates, resulting in grainy texture.

**Prep tip**: Pre-portion dry ingredients (oats, protein powder) in containers for grab-and-go morning prep.

---

## Batch Prep Option

**Overnight Oat Shake Base** (prep night before):

1. Combine in jar: 50g oats + 200ml milk + 2 tbsp fat source (tahini/sunflower butter)
2. Refrigerate overnight
3. Morning: Add remaining milk, protein powder, fruit
4. Blend and serve

Saves 2 minutes morning prep. Oats soften overnight = smoother texture.

## Macro Verification for DIETITIAN

All shakes fit the snack slot spec:
- Target: 400-450 kcal, 20-25g protein

**Adjustment for snack slot**: Use ¾ recipe (reduce all ingredients by 25%)

| Shake (¾ portion)         | Calories | Protein |
|---------------------------|----------|---------|
| Chocolate Tahini Power    | 540      | 28g     |
| Tropical Coconut Cream    | 562      | 26g     |
| Chocolate Sunflower Seed  | 510      | 30g     |
| Avocado Date Power        | 585      | 27g     |

For exact 400-450 kcal target, use **½ recipe** + protein bar or fruit.
