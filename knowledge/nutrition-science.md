## 1. Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)

### 1.1 Distribution Optimization

MPS is the cellular process that builds new muscle protein. It responds to both resistance training and dietary protein in discrete pulses, not continuous flow.

| Study | Design | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Areta 2013 | Crossover, 12 men, whey post-exercise | 4x20g every 3h > 2x40g or 8x10g for 24h MPS | 20g saturates the translational machinery per meal; 10g fails to reach leucine threshold; 40g wastes ~50% to oxidation |
| Mamerow 2014 | 7-day crossover, 8 adults | Even distribution (30/30/30g) = +25% 24h MPS vs skewed breakfast-light (10/15/65g) | Each meal independently triggers MPS; skewing concentrates stimuli and wastes excess at dinner through oxidative disposal |
| Moore 2009 | Dose-response, young men post-exercise | MPS plateaus at ~0.25g/kg/meal (~20g for 80kg) | Beyond plateau, amino acids diverted to urea cycle and oxidation |

### 1.2 Leucine Threshold

Leucine is the primary amino acid that activates mTORC1, the master switch for MPS.

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum leucine per meal to trigger MPS | ~2.5g | Witard 2014 |
| Protein needed to deliver 2.5g leucine (whey) | ~20-25g | ~10% leucine content |
| Protein needed to deliver 2.5g leucine (whole food) | ~25-35g | ~7-8% leucine in chicken, beef, eggs |
| Refractory period after MPS stimulation | ~3-5h | Atherton 2010 — "muscle full" effect |

**Mechanism**: Leucine binds Sestrin2, releasing it from GATOR2, which activates Rag GTPases on the lysosome surface, recruiting mTORC1. mTORC1 phosphorylates p70S6K and 4E-BP1, initiating ribosomal translation of muscle proteins. Below the leucine threshold, mTORC1 activation is incomplete and MPS response is blunted.

### 1.3 Pre-Sleep Protein

| Study | Protocol | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Res 2012 | 40g casein before sleep vs placebo | +22% overnight MPS rate | Casein forms gastric gel, releasing amino acids over 6-7h, maintaining leucine above threshold during sleep |
| Snijders 2015 | 12-week RT + 27.5g casein pre-sleep | Greater muscle fiber cross-sectional area vs placebo | Chronic overnight MPS elevation accumulates into measurable hypertrophy |
| Trommelen 2016 | 40g casein, overnight sampling | Protein digested and absorbed normally during sleep | Gastric emptying and intestinal absorption function during sleep |

**Why casein over whey**: Casein clots in stomach acid (pH ~2), forming a gel matrix. This slows gastric emptying from ~20 min (whey) to ~6-7h (casein), providing sustained aminoacidemia throughout the night. Whey produces a sharp spike that drops below leucine threshold within 2-3h.

### 1.4 Peri-Workout Timing

| Study | Finding | Practical Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Schoenfeld/Aragon/Krieger 2013 | Meta-analysis: post-workout timing effects disappear when daily protein is adequate | No need to rush post-workout shake; total daily intake is the primary driver |
| Kerksick 2017 (ISSN position) | Protein within ~2h window around training is sufficient | Practical range: protein-containing meal 1-2h before OR after training |

**Mechanism**: Resistance exercise sensitizes muscle to amino acids for ~24h (Burd 2011). The "anabolic window" concept overstated the urgency — it is more of an "anabolic barn door." Adequate daily protein ensures the tissue is fed during this extended sensitization period.

## 2. Supplement Mechanisms

### 2.1 Creatine Monohydrate

**Evidence level**: Highest (ISSN Position Stand — Kreider 2017, 680+ trials)

**Mechanism chain**:
1. Oral creatine → absorbed in intestine → enters bloodstream
2. Creatine transporter (SLC6A8) carries creatine into muscle cells
3. Creatine kinase phosphorylates creatine → phosphocreatine (PCr)
4. During high-intensity effort: PCr donates phosphate to ADP → regenerates ATP
5. Higher PCr stores = more ATP available per set = more total work capacity
6. More work capacity → greater mechanical tension → greater hypertrophy stimulus

**Water retention mechanism**:
- Creatine is osmotically active: draws ~2.7-3g water per gram stored in muscle
- Total intramuscular creatine increase: ~20-40% with supplementation
- Expected water weight gain: 1-2 kg in weeks 1-3 (intracellular, not subcutaneous)
- This is functional hydration (supports cell signaling and protein synthesis), not bloating

**Female-specific considerations**:
- Equally effective in women (Smith-Ryan 2021 review)
- 3g/day often sufficient for women (vs 5g for men) due to lower total muscle mass
- No evidence of adverse effects at standard doses in women
- Loading phase (20g/day x 5-7 days) optional; 3g/day reaches saturation in ~28 days

### 2.2 Vitamin D3

**Mechanism**: Vitamin D receptors (VDR) present in skeletal muscle tissue. Vitamin D → liver → 25(OH)D → kidneys → 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol). Calcitriol binds VDR in muscle cells, upregulating genes involved in protein synthesis, calcium handling, and type II muscle fiber maintenance.

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sufficient serum 25(OH)D | >75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) | Tomlinson 2015 |
| Supplementation dose | 2,000-4,000 IU/day | Dose depends on baseline, latitude, sun exposure |
| Absorption requirement | Fat-soluble — take with fat-containing meal | Bioavailability ~32% higher with fat |
| Time to steady state | ~3 months at consistent dose | Slow turnover of 25(OH)D |

### 2.3 Magnesium Glycinate

**Mechanism**: Magnesium is a cofactor in 600+ enzymatic reactions. For sleep/recovery relevance:
- Binds GABA-A receptors → enhances inhibitory neurotransmission → promotes sleep onset
- Regulates HPA axis → modulates cortisol clearance
- Required for ATP synthesis (Mg-ATP is the active form)
- Glycinate chelation: the glycine carrier is itself an inhibitory neurotransmitter, providing additive sleep benefit

**Why glycinate over other forms**: Glycinate has the highest bioavailability with the lowest GI side effects. Oxide is ~4% bioavailable; citrate causes loose stools at high doses; glycinate is ~80% bioavailable and well-tolerated.

### 2.4 Omega-3 (EPA + DHA)

| Study | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Smith 2011 | ~3x MPS augmentation when omega-3 combined with amino acid infusion | EPA/DHA incorporate into muscle cell membranes, increasing membrane fluidity and enhancing mTORC1-p70S6K signaling sensitivity to amino acids |
| McGlory 2016 | 5g/day fish oil for 8 weeks: increased mTORC1 signaling | Membrane phospholipid remodeling takes 4-8 weeks to reach steady state |

**Dose**: 2-4g combined EPA+DHA per day. Anti-inflammatory effect emerges at ~2g/day; MPS augmentation observed at ~3-4g/day.

### 2.5 Ashwagandha (KSM-66)

| Study | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Wankhede 2015 | 300mg 2x/day + RT: +1.6 kg lean mass vs +0.5 kg placebo over 8 weeks | Withanolides modulate cortisol via HPA axis regulation, potentially reducing catabolic signaling |
| Chandrasekhar 2012 | 300mg/day: -27.9% cortisol vs -7.9% placebo | Adaptogenic mechanism: normalizes cortisol curve rather than simply suppressing it |

**Cycling requirement**: 8-12 weeks on, 4 weeks off. Rationale: receptor desensitization may reduce efficacy with continuous use; no long-term (>16 week) safety data at performance doses.

### 2.6 Collagen Peptides

| Study | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Shaw 2017 | 15g gelatin + 50mg vit C 60 min pre-exercise: doubled collagen synthesis markers (PINP) | Hydroxyproline and proline from collagen are preferentially taken up by fibroblasts in tendons/ligaments; vitamin C is a required cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase in collagen cross-linking |

**Timing specificity**: 30-60 min pre-training is critical. Peak serum amino acid levels from collagen coincide with exercise-induced blood flow to tendons, maximizing substrate delivery during the period of highest collagen turnover.

### 2.7 Supplement Interaction Matrix

| Interaction | Effect | Separation Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Calcium + Iron | Calcium inhibits DMT1 and ferroportin iron transporters | Separate by ≥2h |
| Iron + Vitamin C | Vitamin C reduces Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺ (the absorbable form) | Take together |
| Vitamin D + Fat | Fat-soluble vitamin requires micelle formation | Take with fat-containing meal |
| Creatine + Caffeine | Conflicting data; caffeine may blunt creatine's ergogenic effect | Consider separating if sensitive |
| Magnesium + Zinc | Compete for absorption at high doses | Take zinc with food, magnesium at bedtime |
| Collagen + Vitamin C | Vitamin C is cofactor for collagen synthesis | Take together 30-60 min pre-training |

## 3. Menstrual Cycle and Nutrition

### 3.1 Phase Characteristics

**Evidence quality note** (Colenso-Semple 2023): Most menstrual cycle research is underpowered, poorly controlled for cycle phase verification, and conducted in heterogeneous populations. Apply these findings as general guidance, not rigid rules.

| Phase | Days (28-day cycle) | Dominant Hormones | Metabolic Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early follicular | 1-5 (menstruation) | Low estrogen, low progesterone | Baseline metabolic state; insulin sensitivity normal |
| Late follicular | 6-14 | Rising estrogen, low progesterone | Highest insulin sensitivity; highest carb tolerance; estrogen is anabolic (upregulates satellite cell activation) |
| Ovulation | ~14 | Estrogen peak, LH surge | Peak strength potential in some women |
| Early luteal | 15-21 | Rising progesterone, moderate estrogen | TDEE begins increasing; progesterone is thermogenic (+0.3-0.5C body temp) |
| Late luteal | 22-28 | High progesterone, falling estrogen | TDEE +5-10% above follicular baseline; water retention 0.5-2.3 kg; appetite often increases; progesterone has diuretic-then-rebound effect |

### 3.2 TDEE Fluctuation

| Study | Finding |
|---|---|
| Webb 1986 | Luteal phase BMR +8-16% above follicular in some women |
| Bisdee 1989 | Mean increase ~150 kcal/day in luteal vs follicular |
| Barr 1995 | Energy intake spontaneously increases ~200-500 kcal/day in luteal |

**Practical range for this client**: TDEE increases 5-10% (~100-200 kcal) during luteal phase. This is driven by progesterone's thermogenic effect (increased core temperature = increased BMR).

### 3.3 Water Retention Mechanisms

Luteal phase water retention is caused by:
1. **Progesterone → aldosterone competition**: Progesterone competes with aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, initially causing sodium loss → compensatory aldosterone increase → sodium and water retention in late luteal
2. **Estrogen**: Increases renal sodium reabsorption and plasma volume expansion
3. **Expected range**: 0.5-2.3 kg, resolving within days 1-5 of next cycle

**Tracking implication**: Weight comparisons must be made at the same cycle phase month-over-month (ideally days 7-10, mid-follicular, when water retention is minimal).

### 3.4 Cycle-Based Nutrition Strategy

| Phase | Calorie Adjustment | Carb Strategy | Training Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Follicular (days 1-14) | Standard targets | Higher carb tolerance — optimize glycogen loading | Push volume and intensity when energy permits |
| Luteal (days 15-28) | Allow +100-200 kcal if appetite supports | Maintain carb intake; do not reduce for water weight | Allow lighter sessions in late luteal if needed; do not skip weeks |

**Critical rule**: Never reduce calories during luteal phase to compensate for water weight. This is counterproductive — the water weight is transient, but the caloric deficit is real.

## 4. Calcium-Iron Absorption Science

### 4.1 Inhibition Mechanism

| Study | Finding |
|---|---|
| Hallberg 1991 | 165mg calcium reduces non-heme iron absorption by 50-60% |
| Roughead 2005 | Long-term studies show less dramatic effect (~20-30%) due to adaptation |

**Mechanism**: Calcium inhibits iron absorption at two points:
1. **DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1)**: Calcium competes with Fe²⁺ for transport across the enterocyte apical membrane
2. **Ferroportin**: Calcium may reduce basolateral iron export

A single glass of milk (~300mg Ca) consumed with an iron-rich meal can reduce iron absorption by ~50-60% acutely.

### 4.2 Iron Optimization

| Strategy | Mechanism | Practical Application |
|---|---|---|
| Vitamin C with iron | Reduces Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺ (absorbable form); chelates iron in soluble complex | 50mg vitamin C doubles non-heme iron absorption; partially counteracts calcium |
| Empty stomach | Fewer competing minerals and phytates | Iron supplements: morning, empty stomach, with vitamin C source |
| Heme vs non-heme | Heme iron (meat) absorbed via HCP1, unaffected by calcium | Red meat iron absorption ~25% vs plant iron ~2-5% |

### 4.3 Practical Separation Schedule

| Timing | Iron-Optimized | Calcium-Optimized | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | Fortified cereal, eggs | Avoid dairy | Pair iron sources with vitamin C (orange juice, bell pepper) |
| Mid-morning snack | — | Greek yogurt, cheese | 2+ hours after iron-rich breakfast |
| Lunch | Red meat, legumes, dark greens | Minimal dairy | Pair with vitamin C source (tomato, lemon dressing) |
| Afternoon snack | — | Milk, fortified foods | 2+ hours after iron-rich lunch |
| Dinner | Poultry, fish, tofu | Minimal dairy | Pair with vitamin C |
| Bedtime | — | Calcium supplement | 2+ hours after dinner |

## 5. Hardgainer Physiology

### 5.1 Appetite Regulation

| Study | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| DiMeglio & Mattes 2000 | Liquid calories induce less satiety than isocaloric solid food | Liquids bypass oral processing time, have faster gastric emptying, produce weaker incretin hormone response (GLP-1, PYY) |
| Levitsky 2005 | Appetite regulation adapts to chronic intake levels | Hypothalamic set point for hunger signals recalibrates over 2-4 weeks of consistent higher intake |
| Geliebter 1988 | Gastric accommodation increases with repeated large-volume intake | Stomach smooth muscle relaxation threshold increases; larger meals become comfortable over time |

### 5.2 NEAT and Weight Gain Resistance

| Study | Finding |
|---|---|
| Levine 1999 | NEAT varies up to 2,000 kcal/day between similar-sized individuals |
| Levine 2000 | Fidgeting increases energy expenditure +54% seated, +94% standing |
| Bouchard 1990 | 100% of 12 twin pairs gained weight under controlled 1,000 kcal/day surplus |

**Mechanism**: When caloric surplus is introduced, the body upregulates non-exercise activity — fidgeting, posture adjustments, spontaneous standing — as a homeostatic defense against weight change. This can offset 200-600 kcal/day of surplus, making weight gain slower than expected.

**Detection**: If no weight gain despite verified caloric surplus for 2+ weeks post-adaptation, NEAT upregulation is the likely cause → add 200-300 kcal.

### 5.3 Calorie Density Hierarchy

Prioritize calorie-dense foods to minimize stomach volume while maximizing caloric intake:

| Strategy | Mechanism | Caloric Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Whole milk over skim | Fat adds 9 kcal/g vs carb/protein at 4 kcal/g | +80 kcal per 250ml serving |
| Olive oil finishing drizzle | 1 tbsp = 15ml of pure fat | +120 kcal per tablespoon |
| Dried fruit over fresh | Water removal concentrates sugars 4-5x | Dates: 280 kcal/100g vs grapes: 70 kcal/100g |
| Full-fat dairy | Higher fat content per serving | Greek yogurt full-fat: 100 kcal/100g vs 0%: 59 kcal/100g |
| Granola over plain oats | Added oils and sugars | ~450 kcal/100g vs ~370 kcal/100g |
| Tahini/seed butters | High fat, moderate protein | ~89-99 kcal/tbsp |

### 5.4 Liquid Calorie Strategy

**Why liquids work for hardgainers**:
1. Faster gastric emptying (30-60 min vs 2-4h for solid meals)
2. Less oral processing (chewing fatigue is real at high intake)
3. Weaker satiety hormone response (less GLP-1 and PYY release)
4. Can be consumed passively (sipping while working)

**Target**: 1 daily shake minimum (600-800 kcal). On low-appetite days, up to 2 shakes. Shake replaces the snack slot; second shake can replace breakfast if solid food is intolerable.

## 6. Fiber in High-Calorie Diets

### 6.1 Requirements and Risks

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ideal intake | 25-30g/day | Adequate for GI motility and microbiome health |
| Functional floor | 20g/day | RULES.md minimum |
| Risk threshold | <12g/day | Constipation risk, especially with high protein and creatine |

### 6.2 Low-Volume, High-Fiber Sources

For hardgainers, fiber sources must not displace calorie-dense foods:

| Source | Fiber | Per | Volume Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Psyllium husk | 7g | 1 tbsp | Minimal — dissolves in liquid |
| Ground flaxseed | 4g | 1 tbsp | Blends into shakes invisibly |
| Chia seeds | 5g | 1 tbsp | Absorbs liquid; add to oats |
| Wheat bran | 6g | 2 tbsp | Sprinkle on cereal/yogurt |

**Hydration coupling**: Every 5g supplemental fiber requires ~250ml additional water for proper gel formation and transit.

---

## 7. Hydration Science

### 7.1 Base Calculation

| Component | Volume | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Base requirement | 30-35 ml/kg (~1,700-2,000 ml at 56 kg) | Standard maintenance |
| Creatine addition | +300-500 ml | Compensate for intracellular water sequestration |
| Training addition | +500 ml | Exercise-induced sweat and respiratory water loss |
| Fiber addition | +250 ml per 5g supplemental fiber | Fiber hydration for proper transit |
| **Total estimate** | ~2,800 ml/day (~50 ml/kg) | At 56 kg with creatine and training |

### 7.2 Luteal Phase Adjustment

Add 200-300 ml during luteal phase. Progesterone's initial diuretic effect (competing with aldosterone) increases fluid loss before the compensatory retention phase.

### 7.3 Timing Rule

Drink liquids AFTER meals, not during. Rationale: liquid consumed during meals increases gastric volume without adding calories, triggers stretch-receptor satiety signals, and can reduce food intake by 10-15% (Davy 2008). For hardgainers, this works against the goal.
