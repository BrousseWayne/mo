## 1. Protein Behavior Under Heat

### 1.1 Denaturation Chain

Proteins denature (unfold) at specific temperature thresholds. The sequence matters for texture and moisture.

| Temperature | Event | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| ~40C (104F) | Myosin begins to denature | Meat firms slightly, turns opaque at edges |
| 50-53C (122-127F) | Myosin denaturation completes | Meat is firm but still juicy; medium-rare beef zone |
| 56-60C (133-140F) | Collagen shrinks sharply | Connective tissue contracts; meat tightens |
| 62-65C (144-149F) | Collagen fully denatured | In tough cuts, begins gelatin conversion (needs time) |
| 66-73C (150-163F) | Actin denatures | Massive moisture loss; muscle fibers squeeze out water aggressively |
| 71C+ (160F+) | Collagen-to-gelatin conversion accelerates | With sustained time, tough cuts become tender (braising zone) |
| 80-84C (176-183F) | Ovalbumin denatures | Egg whites fully set |

**Key insight**: The 60-67C window is the sweet spot for most proteins. Myosin is fully denatured (meat is cooked), but actin has not yet contracted (moisture is retained). Above 73C, actin denatures and moisture loss accelerates sharply.

### 1.2 Maillard Reaction

Browning reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that produces hundreds of flavor and aroma compounds.

**Requirements**:
- Surface temperature >140C (280F)
- Low moisture at the surface (water caps temp at 100C)
- Amino acids + reducing sugars present
- Alkaline pH accelerates the reaction

**Acceleration zone**: 140-165C. **Peak efficiency**: 165-200C. Above 200C: carbonization (burning).

**Dry surface is critical**: A wet surface converts heat into steam. Until surface moisture evaporates, the surface stays at 100C — far below the Maillard threshold. Pat proteins dry before searing.

### 1.3 Caramelization

Thermal decomposition of sugars — distinct from Maillard (no amino acids involved).

| Sugar | Caramelization Onset |
|---|---|
| Fructose | ~110C (230F) |
| Glucose | ~160C (320F) |
| Sucrose | ~160C (320F) |
| Lactose | ~202C (395F) |

Produces nutty, butterscotch, toffee, bitter compounds depending on temperature and duration.

### 1.4 Carry-Over Cooking

After removing meat from heat, the hotter outer layers continue transferring energy inward.

| Factor | Low Carryover | High Carryover |
|---|---|---|
| Meat size | Small (steaks) ~2-3C | Large roasts (>1.4 kg) ~3-11C |
| Cooking temperature | Low (107C oven) ~3C | High (177C oven) ~11C |
| Protein type | Fish, poultry (less carryover) | Beef, pork (retain heat well) |

**Rule**: Remove meat 3-6C below target for small cuts, up to 11C below for large roasts at high heat.

### 1.5 Target Internal Temperatures

**Chicken**:

| Cut | USDA Safe Min | Culinary Optimal |
|---|---|---|
| Breast | 74C (165F) instantaneous; or 65C held 1 min | 65-68C |
| Thigh | 74C (165F) | 77-82C (collagen needs higher temp to dissolve into gelatin) |

**Beef**:

| Doneness | Internal Temp |
|---|---|
| Rare | 49-52C |
| Medium-Rare | 54-57C |
| Medium | 60-63C |
| Medium-Well | 65-68C |
| Well-Done | 71C+ |

**Salmon**:

| Doneness | Internal Temp |
|---|---|
| Medium-Rare (chef preferred) | 49-52C |
| Medium | 54-57C |
| USDA minimum | 63C |

**Pork**: USDA minimum for steaks/chops/roasts: 63C + 3-min rest. Ground pork: 71C.

**Eggs**:

| Preparation | Temperature |
|---|---|
| Soft-boiled (runny yolk) | Yolk ~65C; white ~75C |
| Hard-boiled (fully set) | Yolk ~70C; white ~80C |
| Scrambled (creamy) | 63-71C |

### 1.6 Why Breast Dries Out, Why Thighs Forgive

**Chicken breast (lean, low collagen)**: Once internal temp exceeds ~73C, actin denatures and fibers contract aggressively, squeezing out water. No internal mechanism to compensate.

**Chicken thigh / pork shoulder / brisket (collagen-rich)**: High in collagen and intramuscular fat. Collagen converts to gelatin at 71-93C with sustained time. Gelatin coats muscle fibers, replacing the sensation of moisture. Fat renders and bastes internally. These cuts improve with extended cooking at 77-93C.

## 2. Starch and Carbohydrate Behavior

### 2.1 Starch Gelatinization

Starch granules absorb water, swell, and burst when heated in water, thickening liquids and softening grains.

| Starch Source | Gelatinization Range |
|---|---|
| Potato starch | ~56-66C |
| Corn starch | ~62-72C |
| Wheat starch | ~58-64C |
| Rice starch | ~68-78C |
| Complete (general) | ~96C |

**Three stages**: Granule swelling (55-65C) > Crystallite melting (65-80C) > Amylose leaching (80-96C).

**Why rice needs specific water ratios**: Under low-moisture conditions, gelatinization is constrained. Too little water: chalky center. Too much: mushy.

### 2.2 Retrogradation and Resistant Starch

When gelatinized starch cools, amylose and amylopectin reassociate into new crystalline structures.

- Cooling to 4C for 24+ hours maximizes resistant starch (RS type 3)
- Day-old rice has more RS than fresh rice
- Cooked-then-cooled potatoes have lower glycemic response
- Reheating does not fully reverse RS formation

### 2.3 Al Dente Pasta and Glycemic Index

Al dente semolina pasta GI: ~40. Overcooked: ~60.

The incomplete gelatinization in al dente pasta preserves starch structure that resists enzymatic breakdown, slowing glucose absorption. Durum wheat semolina's dense gluten network further encapsulates starch granules.

### 2.4 Dextrinization (Toasting)

Thermal breakdown of starch into shorter-chain dextrins under dry heat. Produces golden-brown color, nutty/toasted flavor, crispy texture. Applications: toast, bread crust, roux, roasted grains, fried coatings.

## 3. Fat Behavior Under Heat

### 3.1 Smoke Points

| Fat/Oil | Smoke Point | Best Use |
|---|---|---|
| Avocado oil (refined) | 249-271C | High-heat searing, deep-frying |
| Ghee / clarified butter | 250-252C | High-heat searing, Indian cooking |
| Refined sunflower oil | 232C | Deep-frying, high-heat roasting |
| Canola oil (refined) | 204-246C | General-purpose high-heat |
| Refined sesame oil | 210C | Stir-frying |
| Extra virgin olive oil | 177-210C | Medium-heat saute, finishing |
| Refined olive oil | 199-243C | Pan-frying, roasting |
| Coconut oil (refined) | 204C | Baking, medium-high heat |
| Coconut oil (virgin) | 177C | Low-medium heat |
| Butter | 177C | Low-medium heat saute, baking |
| Unrefined sesame oil | 177C | Low-heat finishing, dressing |

### 3.2 Beyond the Smoke Point

1. **Hydrolysis**: Triglycerides break into free fatty acids + glycerol
2. **Glycerol decomposition**: Produces acrolein (acrid smoke, toxic irritant)
3. **Lipid oxidation**: Free radicals and volatile aldehydes
4. **Polymerization**: Sticky residue on pans

Result: off-flavors, smoke permeation, degraded nutrition, harmful compounds.

### 3.3 Fat Rendering from Meat

Fat begins to melt at 54-60C.

| Fat Type | Rendering Details |
|---|---|
| Intramuscular (marbling) | Low density; melts easily at ~54C |
| Subcutaneous pork fat | Requires sustained 107-163C |
| Chicken skin | Needs ~163C+ for crisp; lower temps = flabby |
| Pork belly | Pan: 107-149C; roast: 135-163C |

### 3.4 Emulsification

Forcing oil and water into stable suspension via emulsifier + mechanical force.

| Emulsifier | Source |
|---|---|
| Lecithin | Egg yolks, soy |
| Mustard proteins | Prepared mustard |
| Casein | Dairy (cream, cheese) |

**Sauce notes**:
- Vinaigrette: oil-in-vinegar. With mustard: semi-stable. Ratio 3:1 oil to acid.
- Mayonnaise: egg yolk lecithin. Can hold ~80% oil by volume.
- Hollandaise: egg yolks tempered to ~65C, clarified butter slowly incorporated. Hold at 60-65C; above 70C emulsion breaks.

## 4. Fiber and Cellulose

### 4.1 Plant Cell Wall Breakdown

| Temperature | What Happens |
|---|---|
| ~60C | Cell membranes rupture; initial softening |
| ~83-85C | Pectin begins to dissolve |
| ~88-92C | **Pectin critical zone**: snappy to bendy (target for tender-crisp) |
| ~96C+ | Extensive pectin breakdown; cellulose framework collapses |
| Prolonged high heat | Complete structural breakdown; mushy |

### 4.2 Cooking and Nutrient Availability

**Better cooked (heat increases bioavailability)**:
- Tomatoes: lycopene +35% availability
- Carrots: beta-carotene (especially with fat)
- Spinach: iron/calcium (heat reduces oxalic acid binding)

**Better raw (heat destroys key compounds)**:
- Broccoli: sulforaphane (myrosinase destroyed by heat)
- Garlic: allicin (crush and wait 10 min before cooking)

### 4.3 Vitamin Losses by Cooking Method

| Method | Vitamin C Retention |
|---|---|
| Steaming | ~90%+ |
| Microwaving | ~85-90% |
| Stir-frying | ~75-85% |
| Boiling | ~30-50% |

Minerals are not destroyed by heat — only leached via water contact. Use the cooking liquid (soups, stews) to recapture.

## 5. Water Activity and Moisture

### 5.1 Brining vs Dry-Salting

**Wet brining**: Meat submerged in 3-6% salt solution. Salt denatures proteins, increases water-holding capacity. Meat gains 10%+ weight. Can taste waterlogged.

**Dry-salting**: Salt applied to surface. Draws out moisture via osmosis, dissolves in it, then reabsorbs as concentrated brine. No added water; concentrates flavor; drier surface = better sear.

| Cut | Dry Salt Time |
|---|---|
| Steaks | 40 min to 24 hours |
| Whole chicken | 12-24 hours |
| Turkey | 24-48 hours |

### 5.2 Surface Moisture and Searing

Water boils at 100C. Maillard needs >140C. A wet surface cannot sear — it steams. Pat dry + high heat + uncrowded pan.

### 5.3 Marinades

**Acid marinades** (vinegar, citrus, wine, yogurt): Denature surface proteins only (1-2mm depth). Over-marinating >2hr thin / >24hr thick = rubbery exterior.

**Enzymatic marinades**:

| Enzyme | Source | Optimal |
|---|---|---|
| Bromelain | Pineapple | 37-70C |
| Papain | Papaya | 50-70C |
| Actinidin | Kiwi | 1-60C |

15-30 min exposure is typically sufficient. Over-tenderization produces mushy texture. Cooking above 70-80C inactivates these enzymes.

### 5.4 Resting Meat

As outer layers cool, fibers relax, reducing pressure on trapped moisture. Cutting unrested meat loses up to 40% more juice.

| Cut | Rest Time |
|---|---|
| Steaks (2-3 cm) | 5-10 min |
| Roasts (1-2 kg) | 15-20 min |
| Large roasts (3+ kg) | 20-30 min |
