## Part I: Dry Heat Techniques

### 1. SAUTER (Sauteing)

High heat, small amount of fat, constant motion. Pan surface >175C. Thin film of oil shimmers but does not smoke.

**Pan selection**: Heavy-bottomed stainless steel or carbon steel. Nonstick for eggs/fish only. Cast iron for searing over sauter.

**Fat choice by smoke point**: Clarified butter/ghee (250C), avocado oil (271C), or a blend of butter + neutral oil.

**Temperature verification**: Water droplet test (Leidenfrost effect) — a drop should skitter across the surface. Oil should shimmer with faint wisps of vapor.

**Best for**: Chicken cutlets (pounded to 1cm), fish fillets, shrimp, scallops, thin beef/pork, mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers, asparagus tips.

**Critical mistakes**: Overcrowding (creates steam), wet food (steams instead of browning), insufficient heat, moving food too soon, too much fat.

### 2. ROTIR (Roasting)

Dry heat in an oven, uncovered. Heat transfers by convection + radiation.

| Item | Oven Temp | Internal Target |
|---|---|---|
| Whole chicken | 200-220C | 74C thigh |
| Bone-in chicken thighs | 220C | 74-77C |
| Beef rib roast | 110-130C | 52-57C for medium-rare |
| Pork loin | 160-180C | 63C |
| Salmon fillet | 120C | 49-52C |
| Root vegetables | 200-220C | Fork-tender |

**Start high, then reduce**: 220C for 15-20 min (Maillard on skin), then 175-190C (interior cooks through gently). The inverse (low start, high finish) also works.

**Convection oven adjustment**: Reduce temp by 15-25C, reduce time by ~25%.

### 3. GRILLER (Grilling / Broiling)

Direct radiant heat >260C. Heat source below (grilling) or above (broiling/salamander).

**Grill marks**: Place food at 45-degree angle to grate, cook 2-3 min undisturbed, rotate 90 degrees for crosshatch, flip.

**Best for**: Steaks, lamb chops, butterflied chicken, fish steaks, shrimp, zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, asparagus, corn, peaches.

### 4. FRIRE (Frying)

**Deep frying**: Fully submerged at 170-190C. Food must be surface-dried. Batter/breading creates a porous shell that insulates interior while exterior crisps via Maillard. Proper temperature = minimal oil absorption.

**Shallow frying**: Half-submerged at 160-190C. Must flip.

**Best for**: Deep — tempura, fritters, pommes frites, chicken pieces. Shallow — schnitzel, fish meuniere, potato rosti.

## Part II: Moist Heat Techniques

### 5. BRAISER (Braising)

Sear first (dry), then cook slowly in liquid in a covered vessel (moist). For tough, collagen-rich cuts.

**Searing phase**: Develop Maillard crust. Does NOT seal in juices (debunked) — it creates flavor compounds that permeate the braising liquid.

**Braising phase**: Covered vessel, low oven. Collagen dissolves into gelatin at 70-82C with sustained time (2-4 hours). Gelatin gives silky mouthfeel and sauce body.

**Liquid level**: 1/3 to 2/3, not fully submerged. Exposed top surface continues Maillard from radiant oven heat. Full submersion = stewing (different technique, more diluted flavor).

**Temperature**: Liquid should barely simmer, never boil. Oven: 135-165C. Boiling toughens fibers and causes shredding.

**Best for**: Beef chuck, short ribs, osso buco, pork shoulder, lamb shanks, bone-in chicken thighs, oxtail.

### 6. POCHER (Poaching)

Gentle cooking in liquid at 70-85C. Occasional small bubbles, never a rolling simmer.

**Why never boil**: Agitation breaks delicate proteins. Eggs disintegrate, fish flakes prematurely, chicken breast turns stringy.

| Item | Temperature |
|---|---|
| Eggs | 71-74C |
| Fish/seafood | 71-77C |
| Chicken breast | 74-82C |
| Fruit | 75-85C |

**Court-bouillon**: Quick aromatic poaching liquid — water + acid (white wine or lemon) + mirepoix + bouquet garni.

### 7. ETUVER (Sweating)

Cooking gently in a covered vessel using the food's own released moisture. Low heat, no browning. A small amount of fat prevents sticking.

Preserves water-soluble vitamins (no external water to leach into). Goal: softening and flavor concentration.

**Best for**: Onions (aromatic base for soups/sauces), shallots, leeks, zucchini, spinach, fennel, celery.

### 8. BOUILLIR (Boiling)

Full rolling boil at 100C. Rarely used for proteins (too aggressive).

**Correct applications**: Pasta (agitation prevents sticking), blanching vegetables, initial stock boil, potatoes (start cold), grains.

**Blanch and shock**: Immerse vegetables in boiling salted water (timed), then immediately transfer to ice bath. Halts carryover cooking, locks in bright color by stopping chlorophyll degradation.

## Part III: Combined / Special Techniques

### 9. POELER (Pot-Roasting)

Sear, then cook covered in oven with aromatics and generous butter, little to no liquid. Differs from braising: the cooking medium is butter and steam from aromatic vegetables, not liquid.

**Best for**: Whole chicken, veal loin, pork loin, pheasant — proteins too tender for braising but needing moisture retention beyond roasting.

### 10. GLACER (Glazing)

Coating food with concentrated, glossy liquid from reduction of cooking liquid + sugar + fat.

**Vegetable glazing**: Carrots in single layer + butter + sugar + water to barely cover. Simmer uncovered until liquid reduces to syrup, toss to coat.

**A blanc** (white): light finish. **A brun** (brown): continue to lightly caramelize.

### 11. DEGLACER (Deglazing)

Adding liquid to a hot pan to dissolve the fond — caramelized residue after searing.

**Fond is the most concentrated Maillard flavor source in any dish.** Discarding it wastes the most flavorful component.

| Liquid | Effect |
|---|---|
| White wine | Bright, clean; acidity dissolves fond efficiently |
| Red wine | Deeper, tannic; pair with beef and lamb |
| Stock | Adds body; reinforces meat flavor |
| Vinegar | Sharp acidity; excellent with pork and duck |
| Spirits (cognac) | Rich warmth; can flambe |
| Fortified wine (Madeira, Marsala) | Sweet, complex; classic with veal and poultry |

### 12. MONTER AU BEURRE (Mounting with Butter)

Whisking cold butter into warm sauce, off heat, to create emulsion. Adds body, sheen, richness.

**Must be off heat**: Above ~63C, emulsion breaks. Cold butter in small pieces, whisk continuously. Ratio: 1-3 tbsp per 250ml sauce.

**Cannot be reheated** — serve immediately.

## Part IV: Sauce Foundations

### 13. The Five Mother Sauces

Every classical French sauce derives from one of these five. Mother sauce + finishing ingredients = named sauce. Combinatorial framework.

#### Bechamel (Roux + Milk)

White roux + whole milk + nutmeg, salt, white pepper. Simmer 20-30 min.

| Daughter | Addition |
|---|---|
| Mornay | Gruyere/Parmesan |
| Soubise | Pureed cooked onions |

| Daughter | Addition |
|---|---|
| Supreme | Cream, reduced mushroom liquid |
| Bercy | Shallots, white wine, fish stock |
| Allemande | Egg yolks, lemon, cream |

#### Espagnole (Roux + Brown Stock)

Brown roux + brown stock (roasted bones) + tomato puree + browned mirepoix. Simmer 4-6 hours.

| Daughter | Addition |
|---|---|
| Demi-glace | Equal parts Espagnole + brown stock, reduced by half |
| Bordelaise | Red wine, shallots, bone marrow |
| Chasseur | Mushrooms, shallots, white wine, tomato |

| Daughter | Addition |
|---|---|
| Provencale | Garlic, olives, herbes de Provence |
| Creole | Onions, peppers, celery, garlic |

#### Hollandaise (Emulsified Butter + Egg Yolk)

Egg yolks whisked over bain-marie to sabayon stage, then warm clarified butter drizzled in slowly. Critical window: 63-75C optimal; above 82C curdles.

| Daughter | Addition |
|---|---|
| Bearnaise | Reduction of vinegar, shallots, tarragon |
| Choron | Bearnaise + tomato puree |
| Mousseline | Whipped cream folded in |

### 14. Roux

Equal parts fat and flour by weight.

| Stage | Cook Time | Color | Thickening |
|---|---|---|---|
| White (blanc) | 30 sec - 1 min | Pale | Highest |
| Blond | 3-4 min | Pale gold | Medium |
| Brown (brun) | 10-12 min | Deep brown | Lowest |

Longer cooking = more flavor but less thickening power. ~60g roux per 500ml liquid for medium body.

### 15. Stock / Bouillon / Fond

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Stock (fond) | Bones + mirepoix + aromatics simmered. Unseasoned. Gelatinous. |
| Broth (bouillon) | Meat + vegetables + seasonings. Lighter, meant for consumption. |
| Fumet | Fish stock, 20-30 min with fish bones and white wine. |

**White stock**: Raw/blanched bones. Pale, clean, delicate. For veloute, poaching, risotto.

**Brown stock**: Roasted bones at 200-220C. Dark, rich, complex (Maillard on bones). For espagnole, demi-glace, braising.

**Dashi**: Kombu steeped to ~60-70C (glutamic acid) + katsuobushi steeped 30 sec - 2 min (inosinic acid). Ready in minutes. Clear, intensely umami.

**Quick alternatives**: Quality boxed stock, bouillon paste, mushroom broth (dried shiitakes 20-30 min), dashi (<10 min), parmesan rind in water, vegetable scraps broth (30-45 min).
