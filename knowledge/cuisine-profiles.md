## Flavor Kit Application Logic

1. Identify the target cuisine
2. Start with the **base aromatics** for that cuisine
3. Cook in the **key fat**
4. Season with **signature flavors** during cooking
5. Balance with **acid** and **sweetness** per the cuisine's philosophy
6. Layer in **umami** and **heat** sources
7. Finish with **fresh herbs/elements**
8. Apply the **defining technique** where possible

**Universal substitution rule**: When an ingredient is unavailable, substitute within the same flavor function (acid for acid, umami for umami), not the same ingredient category.
