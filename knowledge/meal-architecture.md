## 1. Meal Timing and Frequency Science

### 1.1 Five-Meal Structure Evidence

| Study | Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Areta 2013 | 4x20g protein every 3h optimizes 24h MPS vs 2 or 8 feedings | Each feeding independently triggers mTORC1; refractory period ~3-5h means more frequent stimulation requires optimal spacing |
| Mamerow 2014 | Even protein distribution = +25% 24h MPS vs skewed pattern | Skewing protein to one meal wastes excess through oxidative disposal; distributing ensures each meal triggers MPS |
| Arciero 2013 | 6 meals/day improved body composition vs 3 meals in overweight adults | Higher meal frequency with adequate protein at each meal sustained elevated protein synthesis across the day |

**Why 5 meals for this client**:
- 5 meals (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, pre-sleep) allows ~3-4h spacing
- Each meal hits leucine threshold (~20-30g protein)
- Pre-sleep meal captures overnight MPS window (Res 2012)
- Snack slot serves dual purpose: MPS stimulus + liquid calorie opportunity for hardgainers

### 1.2 Meal Timing Windows

| Slot | Optimal Window | Flexibility | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | 07:00-09:00 | ±1h based on wake time | Must be ≤10 min prep OR batch-preppable |
| Lunch | 11:30-13:00 | ±30 min | Largest carb portion; batch-cooked |
| Snack | 15:00-17:00 | ±1h | Portable; can be shake |
| Dinner | 19:00-21:00 | ±1h | Partner-cooked; most variety |
| Pre-sleep | 22:00-23:00 | ±30 min | 30-60 min before sleep; casein-based |

**Inter-meal minimum**: 2.5h (allows gastric emptying and hunger signal reset)
**Inter-meal maximum**: 4.5h (prevents excessive MPS refractory period waste)

### 1.3 Pre-Sleep Protein Timing

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Optimal timing before sleep | 30-60 min | Res 2012 |
| Casein digestion duration | 6-7h (sustained aminoacidemia) | Trommelen 2016 |
| Minimum protein for overnight MPS | 30g (ideal 40g for casein) | Res 2012 |

Pre-sleep must be the simplest, most consistent slot. Decision fatigue is highest at end of day. Limit to 2-3 rotating options that require ≤3 min prep.

## 2. Calorie Ramp-Up Physiology

### 2.1 Gastric Adaptation

| Study | Finding | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Geliebter 1988 | Gastric accommodation increases with repeated large-volume intake | Stomach capacity adapts over 2-3 weeks of consistently larger meals |
| Levitsky 2005 | Appetite regulation adapts to chronic intake levels | Hypothalamic hunger set point recalibrates; takes 2-4 weeks |
| Ard 2006 | Gradual caloric increase improves long-term adherence vs sudden change | Abrupt increase triggers nausea, bloating, and psychological resistance |

### 2.2 Tiered Ramp-Up Protocol

| Tier | When | Daily Target | Strategy | Physiological Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Week 1 | ~2,100 kcal | Keep current habits + add 1 daily shake (~300 kcal surplus) | Minimal GI disruption; stomach begins adapting to extra volume; psychological win (only 1 change) |
| Tier 1 | Week 2 | ~2,300 kcal | Current + shake + stealth calories (olive oil, cheese, butter) | Stomach accommodated to shake; adding calorie density to existing meals avoids volume increase |
| Tier 2 | Week 3+ | ~2,450-2,650 kcal | Full 5-meal template | Gastric accommodation sufficient for full meal plan; hunger signals beginning to recalibrate |

**Transition criteria**: Tier progression requires both time AND subjective tolerance. If client reports persistent nausea/bloating at current tier, hold for another week before advancing.

**Never jump directly to Tier 2 from baseline.** GI distress from sudden caloric increase is the #1 cause of early program abandonment.

### 2.3 Stealth Calorie Strategies

Techniques that add 100-300 kcal to existing meals without increasing perceived portion size:

| Strategy | Caloric Addition | Volume Impact | Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Olive oil finishing drizzle (1 tbsp) | +120 kcal | Negligible | Any cooked meal; drizzle after plating |
| Butter in rice/pasta (1 tbsp) | +100 kcal | None | Mixed into hot carb during serving |
| Cheese finish (20g parmesan/cheddar) | +80 kcal | Minimal | Grated over any savory meal |
| Full-fat dairy swap | +40-80 kcal | None | Replace skim/low-fat with full-fat versions |
| Tahini in dressings (1 tbsp) | +89 kcal | Minimal | Mixed into salad dressings, sauces |
| Honey in yogurt/oats (1 tbsp) | +64 kcal | None | Stirred into breakfast bowls |

## 3. Substitution Science

### 3.1 Substitution Principles

Every substitution must satisfy three constraints simultaneously:

1. **Macro equivalence**: Replacement must be within ±10% of the original's protein, and within ±15% of calories
2. **Functional equivalence**: Replacement must serve the same role in the meal (protein source, carb base, fat source)
3. **Preparation equivalence**: Replacement must not significantly increase prep time or complexity

### 3.2 Protein Substitution Matrix

| Original | Protein/100g | Replacements | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chicken thigh (skin-on) | ~26g | Turkey thigh, pork loin, duck breast | Skin-on preferred for calorie density |
| Chicken breast | ~31g | Turkey breast, pork tenderloin | Lower fat; compensate with added fat source |
| Salmon | ~25g | Trout, mackerel, sardines, arctic char | Oily fish preferred for omega-3 |
| Beef (80/20 ground) | ~26g | Lamb mince, bison, pork mince | Fat percentage matters for calorie targets |
| Eggs (whole) | ~13g per 2 | Egg whites (3:1 ratio) + extra fat source | Yolk provides fat; compensate if removing |
| Greek yogurt (full-fat) | ~9g per 100g | Skyr, quark, cottage cheese | Casein-rich for pre-sleep slot |
| Whey protein | ~24g per scoop | Egg white protein, rice+pea blend | For dairy intolerance |
| Casein protein | ~24g per scoop | Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, quark | Whole food alternatives for pre-sleep |

### 3.3 Carbohydrate Substitution Matrix

| Original | Kcal/100g cooked | Replacements | Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| White rice | ~130 | Jasmine rice, basmati, quinoa, couscous | Rice has highest calorie density per volume |
| Pasta | ~131 | Rice noodles, gnocchi, egg noodles | Cook 1 min less than package for batch durability |
| Potatoes | ~87 | Sweet potato, yam, taro | Slightly lower calorie; compensate with fat |
| Oats | ~370 (dry) | Cream of rice, muesli, granola | Granola is highest density (~450 kcal/100g) |
| Bread | ~265 | Wraps, rice cakes + tahini, naan | Density varies; check labels |

### 3.4 Fat Substitution Matrix (No Peanut/Nut Butters)

| Original | Kcal/tbsp | Replacements | Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Peanut butter~~ | ~~94~~ | Tahini (89), sunflower seed butter (99), avocado (120/half) | All recipes, shakes, spreads |
| ~~Almond butter~~ | ~~98~~ | Same as above | |
| ~~Any nut butter~~ | — | Coconut cream (100/2 tbsp), tahini, sunflower seed butter, avocado | |
| Olive oil | 120 | Avocado oil (120), butter (100), ghee (112) | Cooking and finishing |
| Coconut oil | 117 | Butter, ghee, olive oil | Higher smoke point alternatives for searing |

### 3.5 Emergency Substitution Rules

When a planned ingredient is unavailable:
1. Same macro group first (protein for protein, carb for carb)
2. Similar calorie density (within 15%)
3. Compatible cuisine profile (don't put miso in a Mexican dish)
4. If no suitable substitute exists → default to shake for that slot

## 4. Compliance Psychology

### 4.1 Decision Fatigue and Meal Compliance

| Study | Finding | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Baumeister 2008 | Decision-making depletes a limited cognitive resource | Pre-planned meals remove daily food decisions; compliance increases |
| Wansink 2004 | Environmental design influences eating behavior more than willpower | Container pre-portioning, visible meal schedule, pre-made shakes |
| Lally 2010 | Habit formation takes average 66 days (range 18-254) | First 8 weeks are critical; maximize structure during this period |

### 4.2 Compliance Predictors by Slot

| Slot | Compliance Risk | Primary Barrier | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | Medium | Morning appetite suppression; time pressure | Batch-preppable options (overnight oats); shake fallback |
| Lunch | Low | Partner batch-cooks; planned in advance | Keep 2-3 alternatives stocked |
| Snack | Low-Medium | Forgetting; not at home | Portable options; set phone alarm |
| Dinner | Low | Partner cooks; social meal | Cuisine variety maintains interest |
| Pre-sleep | High | Tiredness; feels unnecessary; "already ate enough" | Simplify to 2 options; frame as "medicine" not "meal" |

### 4.3 Compliance Recovery Rules

| Scenario | Recovery Strategy | Caloric Math |
|---|---|---|
| Missed breakfast | Add 150 kcal to lunch + have full shake at snack | ~+150-200 kcal recovered |
| Missed snack | Increase dinner by 150 kcal + add calorie booster | ~+200 kcal recovered |
| Missed dinner | Double shake + larger pre-sleep | ~+400-500 kcal recovered |
| Missed pre-sleep | No recovery needed if dinner was full | Casein MPS benefit lost, not calories |
| Missed 2+ meals | Trigger minimum viable day protocol | Floor at 1,800 kcal |

## 5. Batch Cooking Architecture

### 5.1 Session Design

| Parameter | Batch A (Sunday) | Batch B (Wednesday) |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | 2-2.5 hours | 2-2.5 hours |
| Produces | Lunch + Dinner | Lunch + Dinner |
| Covers | Mon-Wed | Thu-Sat |
| Protein volume | 1.5-2 kg | 1.5-2 kg |
| Carb volume | 500g dry (rice/pasta) | 500g dry |
| Sauce count | 2-3 varieties | 2-3 varieties |

Sunday is rest day — no batch cooking. Flexible/restaurant/simple options.

### 5.2 Batch-Friendly vs Non-Batch Slots

| Slot | Batch Source | Daily Prep Required |
|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | Can be batch-preppable (overnight oats, egg muffins) OR daily quick-prep | 0-10 min |
| Lunch | Always from batch | 0-5 min (reheat + assemble) |
| Snack | Never batch — always fresh/shake | 2-5 min |
| Dinner | Always from batch | 5-10 min (reheat + sauce + finish) |
| Pre-sleep | Never batch — always fresh | 1-3 min |

### 5.3 Storage Constraints

| Component | Fridge (days) | Freezer | Reheating Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cooked chicken | 4 | 3 months | Microwave + broth splash |
| Cooked ground beef | 4 | 3 months | Stovetop with lid |
| Cooked salmon | 3 | 2 months | Oven 150C only (microwave destroys texture) |
| Cooked rice | 5 | 6 months | Microwave + water splash |
| Cooked pasta | 5 | 2 months | Quick boil or microwave |
| Sauces | 7 | 3 months | Room temp or microwave |

## 6. Emergency and Contingency Protocols

### 6.1 Minimum Viable Day

For days when appetite is zero (illness, stress, exhaustion):

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum calories | ~1,800 kcal | Approximately maintenance — prevents catabolism |
| Minimum protein | ~85g | Above leucine threshold at 3 feedings |
| Maximum frequency | 2x per week | Beyond this → compliance issue → escalate |
| Framing | "Maintenance mode — protecting your base" | Prevents guilt and all-or-nothing thinking |

**Composition**:
1. Morning shake (~650 kcal, ~35g protein): banana + oats + whey + tahini + whole milk
2. Afternoon shake (~600 kcal, ~30g protein): berries + casein + coconut cream + honey + milk
3. Evening minimal meal (~550 kcal, ~20g protein): whatever tolerable (toast + cheese + eggs suggested)

### 6.2 Solo Week Protocol

When partner is unavailable for cooking:

| Parameter | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| Cooking complexity | Max 5 steps, max 15 min prep per meal |
| Shake frequency | Up to 2/day (snack + one meal replacement) |
| Approved shortcuts | Rotisserie chicken, pre-cooked rice, canned tuna/salmon, eggs, macro-checked frozen meals |
| Meal variety | Allow repeats (compliance > variety temporarily) |
| Prep strategy | Pre-portion all ingredients for the week on day 1 |

### 6.3 Travel/Restaurant Protocol

| Situation | Strategy | Calorie Floor |
|---|---|---|
| Airport/plane | Pack 2 protein bars + nuts + dried fruit + seed butter packets | 900 kcal |
| Restaurant | Order protein + starch, request olive oil/butter on side | 500 kcal minimum |
| Hotel breakfast | Eggs (3+) + cheese + bread + yogurt + fruit | 600 kcal |
| Skipped meal (travel) | Double next meal + shake | Recover within same day |

## 7. Slot Specification Grammar

### 7.1 Slot Spec Fields

Every meal slot is defined by a specification object that CHEF uses to generate recipes:

| Field | Type | Description | Determined By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protein_g` | number | Target protein for this slot | NUTRITIONIST protein distribution |
| `calories` | number | Target calories for this slot | Daily total / slot allocation |
| `carbs_g` | number | Target carbs for this slot | Macro balance for meal type |
| `fat_g` | number | Target fat for this slot | Macro balance for meal type |
| `prep_time_max_min` | number | Maximum preparation time | Slot type (breakfast ≤10, dinner ≤45) |
| `constraints` | string[] | Preparation and dietary constraints | Client profile + slot type |
| `primary_protein` | string or null | Protein source assignment | Rotation schedule |
| `cuisine_preference` | string or null | Cuisine for this slot | Weekly rotation |
| `batch_portion` | number or null | Servings from batch cook | Batch schedule alignment |

### 7.2 Constraint Vocabulary

| Constraint | Meaning | Applies To |
|---|---|---|
| `fast_prep` | ≤10 min total prep | Breakfast, snack |
| `batch_cookable` | Must be producible in batch session | Lunch, dinner |
| `partner_prepared` | Partner handles cooking | Lunch, dinner |
| `portable` | Can be transported/eaten outside home | Snack, some lunches |
| `can_be_shake` | Liquid meal acceptable | Snack |
| `casein_based` | Slow-digesting protein required | Pre-sleep |
| `simple` | ≤3 min prep, ≤3 ingredients | Pre-sleep |
| `no_nut_butters` | No peanut butter or nut butters | All slots |

### 7.3 Calorie Allocation by Slot

| Slot | Calorie Range | % of Daily Total (~2,500 kcal) | Macro Emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | 500-550 | 20-22% | Balanced protein + carbs |
| Lunch | 600-650 | 24-26% | Highest carbs (glycogen loading) |
| Snack | 400-450 | 16-18% | Flexible; often liquid |
| Dinner | 600-650 | 24-26% | Balanced; most variety |
| Pre-sleep | 300-350 | 12-14% | High protein, moderate fat, low carbs |

---

## 8. Rotation and Variety Rules

### 8.1 Anti-Monotony Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| No dinner appears >2x/week | Prevents food fatigue and ensures micronutrient variety |
| No protein source at lunch AND dinner same day | Prevents single-source fatigue; ensures amino acid profile variety |
| Minimum 3 distinct cuisines per week | Cultural flavor variety prevents boredom; different spice profiles provide different micronutrients |
| Breakfast can repeat daily (max 2 rotating options) | Breakfast benefits from routine; decision fatigue is highest in the morning |
| Pre-sleep rotation: 2-3 options max | Simplicity = compliance for end-of-day slot |

### 8.2 Protein Rotation Template

| Frequency | Protein | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 3-4x/week | Chicken (thigh preferred) | High density, versatile, affordable, batch-friendly |
| 2x/week | Salmon/fatty fish | Omega-3, flavor variety, distinct textures |
| 1-2x/week | Beef/ground beef | Iron, zinc, density, different flavor profile |
| Daily | Eggs (breakfast) | Convenience, complete amino acid profile |
| Daily | Dairy proteins (yogurt, cottage cheese, casein) | Pre-sleep and snack staples |

---

## 9. Food Tracking Progression

### 9.1 Phase 1: Full Tracking (Weeks 1-4)

| Method | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Food scale + app | MyFitnessPal or equivalent | Build mental portion database; identify under-eating patterns |
| Weigh everything | Including oils, sauces, spreads | These are the most commonly under-estimated calorie sources |
| Review metric | Weekly totals, not daily | Removes day-to-day anxiety; focuses on trend |

### 9.2 Phase 2: Portion Estimation (Weeks 5+)

| Visual Cue | Macro | Approximate Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Palm of hand | Protein portion | ~25-30g protein (120-150g cooked meat) |
| Closed fist | Carb portion | ~40-50g carbs (150-200g cooked rice) |
| Thumb | Fat portion | ~10-15g fat (~1 tbsp oil/butter) |

### 9.3 Re-engagement Triggers

Return to full tracking if:
- Weight stall detected (>2 weeks no change, post-adaptation)
- User requests recalibration
- Major schedule change (new job, travel period, partner availability change)
