# COMPLETE PROTOCOL: FROM 55 KG TO 65 KG

## Biohacking Plan for Women with Difficulty Gaining Weight — Science-Based, Anchored in YOUR Body

---

## YOUR STARTING POINT

You're not a generic statistic. Here's what we know about you, and why each recommendation follows:

**The numbers**: 174 cm, 55 kg, BMI 18.5 — at the lower limit of healthy weight. Goal: 65 kg (+10 kg).

**What your body shows**: Upper body is underdeveloped everywhere — very thin arms, flat back, flat chest. Despite structurally wide hips, the lower body lacks muscle: glutes are fatty and sagging ("they jiggle"), hamstrings are absent, hip dips and saddlebag fat are visible. This is the classic picture of an undermuscled woman with selective gynoid fat storage — you have fat in the right places (hips, glutes), but not the muscle underneath to give it shape and support.

**What this means concretely**: Your glutes "jiggle" not because you have too much fat, but because you don't have enough gluteal muscle to serve as structure. The fat is there, sitting on an empty chassis. When you've built the gluteus maximus and hamstrings, that same fat will be projected backward and upward — the ptosis will disappear. Hip dips are a gluteus medius (middle glute) deficit, not a fat problem: it's missing muscle in the lateral hip zone.

**Complete beginner status is a massive advantage.** Studies show that untrained women gain muscle at the same relative rate as men (Roberts et al., 2020, meta-analysis: effect difference = 0.07, p = 0.31 — not significant). A McMaster review of 111 studies (2025) establishes that a beginner woman can realistically gain about **1 kg of lean mass in 10 weeks**. In your first year, with optimized nutrition and training: **3 to 5 kg of muscle** is realistic, plus 5-7 kg of healthy fat = your goal of +10 kg in 8-14 months.

## PART 1: NUTRITION — LEVER #1

### Why You're Not Gaining Weight (and It's Not Your "Fast Metabolism")

Research has demonstrated that basal metabolic rate (BMR) varies by only **5-8%** between people of the same size and body composition (Johnstone et al., 2005, _American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_, 150 adults). 63% of the variance is explained by lean mass alone. The "fast metabolism" myth is exactly that — a myth.

What varies enormously is **NEAT** (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis): unconscious movements, fidgeting, standing up often, walking without thinking about it. The study by Levine et al. (1999, _Science_) showed that during overfeeding of 1,000 kcal/day for 8 weeks, NEAT variations explained **differences in fat storage by a factor of 10** (r = 0.77). Some people unconsciously increase their expenditure by **700 kcal/day** just by moving more.

**What this means for you**: You're probably not gaining weight because (a) you eat less than you think (food tracking studies show that "hardgainers" overestimate their intake by 20-50%), and/or (b) your NEAT unconsciously compensates for any caloric surplus. The solution isn't mysterious: you need to eat more than your body expends, in a measurable and consistent way.

### Your Caloric Targets — Calculated for YOUR Body

**Estimated BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor)**: 10 × 55 + 6.25 × 174 - 5 × 28 - 161 = **~1,327 kcal/day**

**TDEE with moderate activity** (3-4 sessions/week, factor 1.55): **~2,057 kcal/day**

**With surplus of +400-500 kcal**: **~2,450 - 2,550 kcal/day**

> **Target: 2,500 kcal/day to start.** If after 2 weeks you're not gaining 0.25-0.5 kg/week on average, increase by 200 kcal. If you're gaining more than 0.75 kg/week, reduce by 150 kcal.

### Macronutrients — Exactly How Much of What

| Macro | Target | Daily Amount | Why This Number |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Protein** | 1.6-2.0 g/kg | **88-110 g** (352-440 kcal) | Morton et al. 2018, meta-analysis of 49 studies: breakpoint at 1.62 g/kg, beyond which no additional benefit |
| **Fat** | ≥25% of calories | **~69 g** (621 kcal) | Mumford et al. 2016, 259 women: dietary fats increase testosterone by 4% and reduce anovulation risk by 58%. Below 20%, sex hormone disruption |
| **Carbs** | The rest | **~220-275 g** (880-1100 kcal) | Fuel for training, glycogen replenishment, mTOR support |

### Protein Distribution — The Detail That Changes Everything

Areta et al. (2013, _The Journal of Physiology_) showed that **4 × 20 g every 3 hours** stimulates muscle protein synthesis better than 2 large meals or 8 small doses. Mamerow et al. (2014) demonstrated in women that distributing protein evenly (30/30/30g) increases 24h MPS by **25%** compared to uneven distribution.

**Your ideal distribution throughout the day:**

- **8am - Breakfast**: 25-30g protein (e.g., 3 eggs + toast + Greek yogurt)
- **12pm - Lunch**: 25-30g protein (e.g., chicken/fish + rice + vegetables + olive oil)
- **4pm - Snack**: 20-25g protein (e.g., protein shake + banana + tahini)
- **8pm - Dinner**: 25-30g protein (e.g., meat/fish + pasta + cheese)
- **10:30pm - Pre-sleep**: 30-40g protein (casein or cottage cheese)

The pre-sleep meal is crucial: Res et al. (2012) showed that 40g of casein before bed increases overnight protein synthesis by **22%**. Snijders et al. (2015) confirmed significantly greater muscle fiber size gains over 12 weeks.

### Specific Strategies for You Who "Aren't Hungry"

The central problem for hardgainers is appetite, not metabolism. Here are research-based hacks:

**1. Liquid calories**: DiMeglio & Mattes (2000) demonstrated that liquid calories produce less satiety than solids. A homemade shake (banana + oats + whey + tahini + whole milk) = **600-800 kcal** in 2 minutes. Have at least one per day.

**2. Calorie density**: Systematically choose the densest versions — whole milk rather than skim (+120 kcal/day), cheese on everything, olive oil on salads and dishes (+100-200 kcal), nuts and dried fruit as snacks (30g almonds = 180 kcal).

**3. Eat on a schedule, not on hunger**: Schedule 5 meals/snacks at fixed times. Never wait until you're hungry — your hunger signal is clearly under-calibrated.

**4. Drink AFTER meals, not before or during**: Liquids during the meal fill the stomach and reduce intake.

**5. Start with dense foods**: Eat the meat/rice FIRST, vegetables after. Don't fill your stomach with fiber and water before calories.

### The "Anabolic Window" — Forget the Myth

Schoenfeld, Aragon & Krieger (2013, meta-analysis of 23 studies): after controlling for total protein intake, **the post-workout timing effect completely disappears**. What matters: your daily total of protein and calories. If you want to optimize, have a protein source within 2-3 hours around training — but don't stress if you eat 45 minutes before and 1 hour after.

## PART 2: TRAINING — DESIGNED FOR YOUR GOALS

### What Science Says About Women and Hypertrophy

Women produce 15-20x less testosterone than men. Yet relative rates of muscle gain are **identical** (Roberts et al., 2020). How? Three compensatory mechanisms:

1. **3x higher GH production**: Women produce about three times more growth hormone than men (Burman et al., 2000, _JCEM_).
2. **Estrogen is anabolic**: Lowe et al. (2010) showed in meta-analysis that estrogen increases muscle strength by ~5% and specific force by ~10%, via satellite cell activation and protein catabolism inhibition.
3. **Unique IGF-1 response**: Women produce free IGF-1 fractions that men don't produce after exercise (Nindl et al., 2019, _Frontiers in Endocrinology_).

**You don't need testosterone to build muscle. Your body has its own anabolic pathways.**

### Frequency and Structure — Why Full Body 3x/Week

Schoenfeld et al. (2016, meta-analysis): training each muscle **≥2x/week** is superior to 1x/week for hypertrophy. For a beginner, full body 3x/week is optimal because:

- Each muscle is stimulated 3x/week
- Volume is distributed to reduce fatigue
- More technical practice on key movements
- 48h recovery between each session

### Volume — How Many Sets Per Muscle

Schoenfeld et al. (2017): dose-response relationship — each additional set increases the effect. The effective minimum is **~10 sets/muscle/week**. Barbalho et al. (2019, 40 trained women): 5-10 sets/week = equal or superior results to 15-20 sets. **Don't bury yourself under volume at the start.**

### YOUR Priority Muscles — Mapped to Your Aesthetic Goals

| Aesthetic Goal | Target Muscle(s) | Weekly Volume | Key Exercises |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Sagging glutes → round and projected | **Gluteus maximus** | 12-15 sets | Hip thrust, squat, RDL |
| Hip dips → filled hips | **Gluteus medius** | 4-6 sets | Side-lying abduction, cable hip abduction |
| Flat thighs → posterior curve | **Hamstrings** | 8-10 sets | RDL, leg curl, split squat |
| Very thin arms → proportionate | **Biceps + triceps** | 4-6 direct sets | Curls, dips/extensions |
| Non-existent back → posture and shape | **Lats + traps** | 9-12 sets | Lat pulldown, rows, face pulls |

**Why the hip thrust is king for your glutes**: Contreras et al. (2015) measured gluteus maximus activation of **69-87% MVIC** in hip thrust versus 29-45% in squat. However, Plotkin et al. (2023, first RCT with MRI measurement) showed that gluteal hypertrophy is **similar** between hip thrust and squat over 9 weeks — but the squat also develops quads and adductors. **Conclusion: do BOTH.** Hip thrust to target gluteus maximus, squat for overall development.

**For hip dips specifically**: Plotkin et al. found **almost no gluteus medius growth** with squats or hip thrusts alone. This muscle requires targeted abduction work (Moore et al., 2020, _IJSPT_). This is non-negotiable in your program.

### Concrete Program — Months 1 to 4

#### DAY A (Monday) — Glutes + Back Focus

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest | Notes for You |
|----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Barbell Hip Thrust | 3 × 10-15 | 2 min | This is your #1 exercise. Start with just the bar, progress gradually. Squeeze glutes AT THE TOP. |
| Goblet Squat → Barbell Squat | 3 × 8-12 | 2 min | Goblet for the first 4 weeks to learn the pattern. Depth: thigh parallel to floor minimum. |
| Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8-12 | 90s | For your non-existent back. Pull elbows toward hips, not hands toward chin. |
| Side-lying Hip Abduction | 2 × 15-20/side | 60s | For your hip dips. Slow control, no momentum. You'll feel the gluteus medius burn. |
| Face Pulls | 2 × 15-20 | 60s | Posture + rear shoulders. |

#### DAY B (Wednesday) — Posterior Focus + Arms

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest | Notes for You |
|----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Romanian Deadlift (RDL) | 3 × 8-12 | 2 min | For your absent hamstrings. Dumbbells at first, barbell later. Feel the stretch behind the thigh. |
| Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 × 10-12/leg | 90s | Unilateral = maximum stimulation. One foot on a bench, lower the back knee. |
| Seated Cable Row | 3 × 8-12 | 90s | Back: pull shoulder blades together. |
| Dumbbell Curls (mind-muscle connection) | 2 × 10-12 | 60s | For your thin arms. Schoenfeld (2018): internal focus increases biceps hypertrophy by 12.4% vs 6.9%. Focus on THE contraction. |
| Cable Hip Abduction | 2 × 15-20/side | 60s | Hip dips again. Standing, low cable, leg outward. |

#### DAY C (Friday) — Full Body Hypertrophy

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest | Notes for You |
|----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Leg Press (feet high and wide) | 3 × 10-15 | 2 min | Feet high = more glute/hamstring. Feet low = more quads. |
| Hip Thrust (banded or barbell) | 3 × 10-15 | 90s | 2nd weekly dose for your glutes. |
| Assisted Pull-ups or Wide Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8-12 | 90s | Progression toward a real pull-up in 6-12 months. |
| Lateral Raises | 3 × 12-15 | 60s | To visually widen the upper body and balance your wide hips. |
| Seated or Lying Leg Curl | 2 × 10-15 | 60s | Hamstring isolation. |

**Total weekly volume**:

- Gluteus maximus: ~12-15 sets (direct + indirect) ✓
- Gluteus medius: ~4-6 sets ✓ ← the key for your hip dips
- Hamstrings: ~8-10 sets ✓
- Back: ~9 sets ✓
- Shoulders: ~5 sets
- Arms: ~2-4 direct sets
- Quads: ~6-9 sets (indirect via squats/leg press)

### Progression — How You Advance

**Double progression** method:

1. Work within the rep range (e.g., 8-12)
2. When you reach the TOP of the range on ALL sets with good form → increase weight by 2.5 kg (upper body) or 5 kg (lower body)
3. Fall back to the BOTTOM of the range with the new weight
4. Repeat

**Effort**: Work at RPE 7-8 (2-3 reps in reserve). Don't go to failure systematically — Refalo et al. (2022): 1-3 RIR = same hypertrophy as failure, with less fatigue.

### Menstrual Cycle and Training

Sung et al. (2014) and Wikström-Frisén et al. (2017) found that concentrating volume in the **follicular phase** (days 1-14) gives better results. BUT the review by Colenso-Semple et al. (2023) notes that evidence quality is low.

**Pragmatic approach**: Train consistently throughout the cycle. If you feel strong and motivated in the follicular phase, push a bit more. If the luteal phase (days 15-28) tires you, give yourself more rest between sets. **Consistency beats cycle optimization every time.**

### After Months 4-6 — Evolution to Upper/Lower 4x/Week

When you plateau on full body 3x (and you will plateau, it's normal), switch to:

- Monday: Lower (glute/hamstring focus)
- Tuesday: Upper (back + shoulders + arms)
- Thursday: Lower (quad + gluteus medius focus)
- Friday: Upper (back + arms + shoulders)

Total volume increased to 14-20 sets for priority muscles.

## PART 3: SUPPLEMENTATION — IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

### Tier 1: Essentials (solid evidence)

**Creatine monohydrate — 3-5 g/day, every day**
The ISSN (Kreider et al., 2017) confirms: >680 clinical trials, 12,800+ participants, no clinical side effects. Safe and effective in women. Women have lower creatine stores, making supplementation potentially more beneficial. The initial 1-3 kg gain is intracellular water — not superficial "bloating," but an anabolic signal. **This is exactly what you want: weight on the scale AND a performance boost.**

**Vitamin D3 — 2,000-4,000 IU/day**
Tomlinson et al. (2015): significant strength improvement in deficient individuals. Target: 40-60 ng/mL in serum. Get a blood test first if possible.

**Magnesium glycinate — 200-400 mg at bedtime**
Improves sleep quality via GABA activation. Often deficient in active people.

### Tier 2: Recommended

**Omega-3 (EPA + DHA) — 2-4 g/day**
Smith et al. (2011): approximately **3-fold increase** in amino acid-stimulated MPS with 4g/day fish oil. Anti-inflammatory and recovery benefits.

**Ashwagandha (KSM-66) — 300-600 mg/day**
Wankhede et al. (2015): significant increase in strength and muscle size + **cortisol reduction of 27.9%** (Chandrasekhar et al., 2012). Particularly useful if you're stressed. 8-12 week cycles.

**Collagen — 10-15 g + 50 mg vitamin C, 30-60 min before training**
Shaw et al. (2017): doubles collagen synthesis. Protects tendons and joints as your loads progress.

### Tier 3: Optional

Zinc (15-30 mg/day if deficient), HMB (3 g/day — modest benefit for beginners).

---

## PART 4: SLEEP — NOCTURNAL GROWTH HORMONE

Lamon et al. (2021): **one night of deprivation** reduces MPS by 18%, increases cortisol by 21%, decreases testosterone by 24%. The GH peak (70% of daily production) occurs in the first 1-2 hours of deep sleep.

**Sleep protocol:**

- **7-9 hours per night**, non-negotiable
- Consistent schedule (±30 min)
- Cool room: 18-20°C
- No screens 1 hour before bed (or night mode + low brightness)
- 30-40g casein + 200-400 mg magnesium glycinate at bedtime = dual role: overnight MPS + sleep quality

---

## PART 5: NATURAL HORMONAL OPTIMIZATION

### Your BMI 18.5 Is Probably THE Hormonal Problem

Being in chronic energy insufficiency (even slight) suppresses the HPG axis: estrogen drops, progesterone falls, testosterone is minimal, thyroid T3 decreases (slowing metabolism as a protective mechanism), cortisol rises (catabolic), and leptin falls below the ~3 ng/mL threshold needed for ovulation.

Mallinson et al. (2013): two amenorrheic women who simply increased their caloric intake saw their periods return in **23 and 74 days** respectively, with normalization of T3, leptin, and resting metabolism.

**The caloric surplus is your best hormonal intervention.** Not supplements, not special routines — eating enough.

### Other Natural Levers

- **Compound training** (squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts) = greatest acute GH/testosterone response
- **Sleep 7-9h** = maximum GH
- **Stress management**: 10-20 min of meditation/day (multiple systematic reviews: cortisol reduction)
- **Sauna** (if accessible): Leppäluoto et al.: acute GH increase of 2-16x (habituates with use)
- **AVOID cold post-training**: Roberts et al. (2015, _The Journal of Physiology_): 12 weeks of post-training cold immersion = **-13 percentage points** on quad mass gain + attenuation of satellite cell activation. Piñero et al. (2024, first meta-analysis) confirms. **No cold baths after strength training.**

---

## PART 6: NEAT MANAGEMENT — THE HIDDEN LEVER

Since NEAT can vary by 2,000 kcal/day (Levine, 2004) and it's the main mechanism of weight gain resistance in "hardgainers," you must monitor it.

**Rules:**

- **5,000-7,000 steps/day max** — enough for cardiovascular health without burning your calories
- Limit dedicated cardio to 1-2 sessions of 15-20 min at low intensity per week
- If you have a job where you're standing/moving all day, **increase your calories by 200-300 kcal** to compensate
- If your weight isn't rising despite the target surplus, it's your NEAT that has unconsciously increased → add 200-300 kcal

---

## PART 7: TRACKING AND ADJUSTMENTS

### What to Measure and When

| Measurement | Frequency | How |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| **Weight** | Daily, fasted in the morning | Take the WEEKLY AVERAGE. Ignore daily fluctuations (water, hormones). |
| **Hip circumference** | Every 2 weeks | At the widest point of the glutes. This is your main marker. |
| **Thigh circumference** | Every 2 weeks | At mid-thigh. |
| **Arm circumference** | Every 2 weeks | Flexed arm, contracted, at the largest point. |
| **Waist circumference** | Every 2 weeks | At the navel. |
| **Photos** | Monthly | Same lighting, same pose, same time. Front, side, back. |
| **Training log** | Each session | Exercises, weights, sets, reps. Progressive overload is the main driver. |
| **Subjective markers** | Weekly | Energy, sleep quality, mood, period regularity, appetite. |

### Adjustment Rules

- **Gain < 0.25 kg/week for 2 consecutive weeks** → +200 kcal/day
- **Gain > 0.75 kg/week** → -150 kcal/day (you're gaining too much fat too fast)
- **Gain 0.25-0.5 kg/week** → perfect, change nothing
- **Plateau on an exercise for 3 sessions** → change the variant or add a set

### Optional DEXA Scan

If you can, get a DEXA every 3-6 months. It's the gold standard for seeing exactly how much muscle vs fat you're gaining, and WHERE.

---

## PART 8: FAT DISTRIBUTION — WHY YOU STORE THERE

You store at hips/thighs/glutes because of **estrogen**. Pedersen et al. (2004, _JCEM_) identified the mechanism: estradiol increases alpha-2A adrenergic receptors (antilipolytic) in subcutaneous adipose tissue — but only in subcutaneous deposits, not visceral. Result: gluteofemoral fat in premenopausal women resists lipolysis more than abdominal fat.

**What this means for you**: When you enter a caloric surplus, estrogen will direct new fat preferentially to the **hips, thighs, and glutes** — not to the belly. This is metabolically protective and aesthetically aligned with your goals. You want volume in the glutes and thighs? You'll get it, naturally, through pure biology.

The "saddlebags" and "hip dips" won't get worse — on the contrary:

- **Saddlebags** are normal gynoid storage. With muscle underneath, they'll be better supported and visually integrated into a muscular curve.
- **Hip dips** are a gluteus medius muscle deficit. Abduction work will literally fill this zone with muscle, reducing the "dip."

---

## REALISTIC TIMELINE — WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT

| Period | Estimated Weight | What's Happening | What You'll See |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Months 1-2** | 56-58 kg | Rapid initial gain (glycogen, water, creatine, beginning of fat). Neural adaptation to exercises. | The scale rises quickly. Your clothes start to fit tighter at the thighs. No major visible muscle change yet. |
| **Months 3-4** | 58-60 kg | Peak of "newbie gains." 1-2 kg of muscle acquired. Fat filling out the contours. | Your arms are a bit fuller. Your glutes are starting to have shape — ptosis diminishes. You feel your muscles working. |
| **Months 5-8** | 60-63 kg | Visible hypertrophy. Strength increasing rapidly. Fat distributing harmoniously. | Hip dips fading. Your glutes project. Your back has lines. People start making comments. |
| **Months 9-14** | 63-65 kg | Goal achieved. Muscle growth slows but continues. | You wear different size clothes. The "jiggle" is still there but WITH shape underneath. The curve is there. |

**Total estimated at 65 kg**: ~3-5 kg of muscle + ~5-7 kg of healthy fat. BMI: 21.5 — middle of the optimal zone.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — YOUR DAILY CHECKLIST

☐ **2,500 kcal consumed** (weighed or estimated with precision)
☐ **88-110 g of protein** distributed in 4-5 servings of ~25-30g
☐ **30-40 g of casein/cottage cheese before bed**
☐ **3-5 g creatine** (in any meal or shake)
☐ **2,000-4,000 IU vitamin D3**
☐ **Training 3x/week** with progressive overload
☐ **Hip thrusts + abductions** in every lower body session
☐ **7-9 hours of sleep**
☐ **5,000-7,000 steps/day** (not more)
☐ **Morning weigh-in** (weekly average)

This isn't magic. It's biology applied with rigor and patience. Every beginner woman who followed these principles in the cited studies gained muscle and weight. There is no documented exception when the caloric surplus is real and training is structured.

**Your body isn't "incapable of gaining weight." It's just waiting for the right signals.**
