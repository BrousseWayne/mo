## 1. The Seven Taste Elements

### 1.1 Salt

Salt amplifies existing flavors — makes everything taste like a stronger version of itself. Suppresses bitterness at the receptor level. Enhances sweetness in small amounts. Increases perceived umami.

**Types**:
- Kosher salt: coarse, easy to pinch, dissolves evenly. Use during cooking.
- Flaky salt (Maldon, fleur de sel): finishing only. Textural crunch + salinity bursts.
- Table salt: fine, dense, iodized. ~1.5x saltier by volume than kosher.

**Undersalting is the most common home-cooking error.** If a dish tastes flat despite correct ingredients, add salt first before anything else.

### 1.2 Acid

Acid provides brightness — makes food taste alive and fresh. Cuts through richness and fat. Separates and defines flavors that would otherwise blur together.

**Sources by intensity**:
- Strong: lemon juice, lime juice, white wine vinegar, rice vinegar
- Medium: red wine vinegar, white wine (in cooking), yogurt, tomato
- Subtle: balsamic vinegar (also sweet), pomegranate molasses, tamarind

**Acid is the second most common deficiency in home cooking** after salt. A squeeze of lemon at the end can transform a dish.

### 1.3 Fat

Fat carries and distributes flavor compounds (many aroma molecules are fat-soluble). Provides mouth-coating richness and satiation. Enables aromatic extraction (spice blooming). Causes flavors and aromas to linger longer.

**Fat as cooking medium**: Transfers heat, facilitates Maillard, extracts fat-soluble flavors from aromatics and spices.

**Fat as finishing element**: A drizzle of quality olive oil or cold butter mounted into sauce provides fresh aroma and richness that cooking fat cannot.

**Fat suppresses heat**: Capsaicin is fat-soluble. Dairy fat (casein protein) physically dissolves and strips capsaicin from TRPV1 receptors. Whole milk, yogurt, cream work. Water does not (spreads capsaicin further).

| Fat | Character | Best Uses |
|---|---|---|
| Butter | Dairy, nutty, sweet | Moderate-heat saute, finishing, pan sauces |
| Ghee | Nuttier, no milk solids | Indian cooking, high-heat searing |
| EVOO | Peppery, fruity, grassy | Finishing, dressings, low-heat |
| Toasted sesame oil | Intensely nutty | Finishing only (a few drops) |
| Coconut oil (virgin) | Sweet, coconut | Curries, Southeast Asian |
| Neutral oils | No flavor | High-heat frying, searing |

### 1.4 Sugar / Sweetness

Counteracts acidity. Softens bitterness. Rounds out harsh or sharp edges. A small amount in savory dishes smooths and integrates other flavors — not about making food sweet.

**Sources beyond table sugar**: Honey (floral), mirin (Japanese), palm sugar (caramel-like, essential in Thai), caramelized onions (30-45 min slow cook), roasted garlic, reduced balsamic, maple syrup, dates/dried fruit.

### 1.5 Umami

Depth, savoriness, mouth-coating fullness. Makes dishes taste more complete and satisfying.

**The synergy effect**: Glutamate + nucleotides (IMP or GMP) produces umami up to **8x stronger** than glutamate alone. This is the scientific basis for traditional pairings across cultures:
- Dashi: kombu (glutamate) + bonito (inosinate)
- Italian: tomato (glutamate) + parmesan (glutamate) + anchovy (inosinate)
- French stock: meat bones (inosinate) + onion/celery/carrot (glutamate)

**Natural sources by compound**:

| Category | Sources |
|---|---|
| Glutamate (plant/fermented) | Parmesan (1200mg/100g), soy sauce, miso, tomato paste, kombu, nutritional yeast |
| Inosinate (animal) | Bonito flakes, anchovies, sardines, chicken, pork, beef |
| Guanylate (fungi) | Dried shiitake, dried porcini |
| Multi-compound | Fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce |

**MSG**: Sodium salt of glutamic acid. 12g sodium/100g (~1/3 of table salt). FDA/WHO/EFSA classify as safe. Use: 0.5-1g per serving during cooking.

**Umami stacking**: Combine sources from 2+ categories for maximum depth. Example: tomato braise (glutamate) + parmesan rind (glutamate) + fish sauce splash (inosinate + glutamate) + dried porcini (guanylate) = four sources across all three compound types.

### 1.6 Heat / Spice (Piquancy)

Capsaicin activates TRPV1 pain receptors, not taste receptors. Technically a pain signal.

**Controlling heat**: Seeds and white pith contain highest capsaicin. Removing them reduces heat. Heat is additive — once in, cannot be removed, only masked.

**Mitigating excess heat** (priority order):
1. Dairy fat + casein (most effective)
2. Non-dairy fat (coconut milk, avocado)
3. Sugar/sweetness
4. Acid (competing sensation)
5. Starch (absorbs/dilutes)
6. NOT water (spreads capsaicin)

### 1.7 Bitterness

Adds complexity, prevents cloying one-dimensionality. Almost always a background note — value lies in counterpoint.

**Sources**: Charred vegetables, dark chocolate, coffee, radicchio, endive, arugula, turmeric, walnuts.

**Balancing**: Sweetness is the most direct counter. Fat mellows bitterness. Salt suppresses at the receptor level.

## 2. Flavor Balancing Rules

Decision matrix: detected imbalance → corrective actions in priority order.

| Problem | Fix 1 | Fix 2 | Fix 3 | Ingredients |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Too salty | Add acid | Add fat | Add sweetness / dilute | Lemon juice, cream, sugar, unsalted stock |
| Too acidic/sharp | Add fat | Add sweetness | Add salt (small) | Butter, olive oil, honey, palm sugar, cream |
| Too sweet | Add acid | Add bitterness | Add heat | Lemon, vinegar, coffee, cocoa, chili |
| Too bitter | Add salt | Add fat | Add sweetness | Kosher salt, butter, cream, cheese, honey |
| Too bland/flat | Add acid | Add salt | Add umami | Lemon, vinegar, salt, soy sauce, fish sauce, MSG |
| Too rich/heavy | Add acid | Add heat | (Reduce fat) | Lemon, vinegar, pickled elements, chili, ginger |
| Too spicy | Add fat/dairy | Add sweetness | Add acid | Yogurt, cream, coconut milk, sugar, lime |
| Missing depth | Add umami | Add salt | Layer aromatics | Soy sauce, fish sauce, tomato paste, miso, dried mushrooms |
| Muddy/confused | Add acid (brighten) | Textural contrast | Adjust salt | Lemon, rice vinegar, fresh herbs, finishing salt |

**Meta-rules**:
- Salt is the first diagnostic.
- Acid is the second diagnostic. Most home-cooked food is under-acidified.
- Corrections in small increments. Over-correction creates new imbalance.
- Fat + acid = primary richness/brightness pair.
- Sweet + acid = primary sharpness/roundness pair.
- Salt + bitter = primary suppression pair.

## 3. The Seasoning Stack

Professional kitchens build flavor in sequential layers. Each layer has specific timing.

### Layer 1: Base Seasoning (Salt During Cooking)

**When**: From the start. Salt meat in advance, salt cooking water, season aromatics as they sweat.

Salt applied early penetrates and seasons from within. Use 1/3 of total salt at beginning, adjust throughout.

### Layer 2: Aromatic Base

**When**: After heating fat, before main ingredients.

Aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger) contain volatile sulfur compounds and sugars transformed by heat. Cooking in fat: Maillard on allium sugars + extraction of fat-soluble aromatics + softening of harsh raw flavors.

Sweat 5-10 min until translucent and fragrant. Rushing this step is the most common cause of shallow-tasting food.

### Layer 3: Spice Layer (Bloomed in Fat)

**When**: After aromatics softened, before adding liquid.

Adding dry spices to hot fat activates fat-soluble volatile compounds. Cell walls become brittle from heat, releasing essential oils that dissolve into cooking fat. **Blooming produces dramatically more flavor than adding spices to liquid.**

Push aromatics aside, add spices to exposed fat, stir 30-60 seconds until fragrant.

### Layer 4: Sauce / Liquid Layer

**When**: After spices bloomed.

Deglaze with wine (recovers fond, introduces acid). Add stock (umami). Add tomato products (acid + umami). Add soy/fish sauce (umami + salt). This layer integrates and carries all previous layers.

### Layer 5: Finishing Layer

**When**: Just before serving. Never during cooking.

Adds brightness, textural contrast, aromatic freshness that cooking would destroy.

- **Acid**: Fresh lemon/lime juice, splash of vinegar
- **Fresh herbs**: Cilantro, basil, mint, parsley, chives, dill
- **Quality fat**: EVOO drizzle, cold butter in sauce, toasted sesame oil drops
- **Flaky salt**: Maldon, fleur de sel
- **Heat**: Chili flakes, fresh sliced chili, chili oil
- **Alliums**: Sliced scallion, raw shallot
- **Zest**: Lemon, lime, orange

## 4. Global Aromatic Bases

| Base | Components | Fat | Technique |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mirepoix (French) | Onion, carrot, celery (2:1:1) | Butter | Sweat 8-12 min, medium dice |
| Soffritto (Italian) | Onion, carrot, celery | Olive oil | Fine dice, very slow 15-20 min |
| Sofrito (Spanish/Latin) | Onion, garlic, tomato, bell pepper | Olive oil | Cook until tomato concentrates |
| Holy Trinity (Cajun) | Onion, celery, bell pepper (2:1:1) | Oil/butter | Deeper color than mirepoix |
| Chinese Trinity | Ginger, garlic, scallion | Neutral oil | High heat, 15-30 sec until fragrant |
| Indian Base | Onion, garlic, ginger + tadka (whole spices in ghee) | Ghee/coconut oil | Tadka first, then onions golden→brown |

## 5. Spice Science

### 5.1 Blooming / Toasting

**Dry toasting**: Heat makes cell walls brittle, releasing essential oils. Maillard and caramelization on spice surface produce new compounds (nuttier, deeper). Dry skillet, medium heat, 1-3 min, shaking frequently.

**Blooming in fat**: Fat-soluble flavor compounds dissolve into cooking oil for even distribution. More thorough extraction than dry toasting. Add to hot (not smoking) fat, stir 30-60 seconds.

### 5.2 Whole vs Ground

| Property | Whole | Ground |
|---|---|---|
| Shelf life | 2-4 years | 4-8 months |
| Flavor release | Gradual, sustained | Immediate, diminishes quickly |
| Best for | Slow-cooked dishes, tempering/tadka | Quick dishes, rubs, baking |
| Burns | More forgiving | Easily |

Buy whole, grind fresh for maximum flavor.

### 5.3 Building a Spice Blend

Four functional roles:

1. **Anchor / Base (40-60%)**: Dominant flavor, mild enough for quantity. Cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric.
2. **Supporting / Accent (20-30%)**: Complement the anchor. Coriander w/ cumin, fennel w/ coriander, cinnamon w/ paprika.
3. **Heat element (5-15%)**: Cayenne, black pepper, dried ginger, mustard seed.
4. **Aromatic / High-note (5-20%)**: Fragrance. Clove (very sparingly), cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, nutmeg.

Clove, star anise, nutmeg should rarely exceed 5% — they dominate easily.
