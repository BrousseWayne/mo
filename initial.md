# CLIENT INTAKE: BODY RECOMPOSITION PROTOCOL

## BIOMETRIC PROFILE

**Current Stats**:

- Body weight: 56 kg
- Height: 174 cm
- BMI: 18.5 (lower end of normal range)
- Body fat percentage: Unknown (estimation required)
- Somatotype: Suspected phenotype

**Morphological Assessment**:

- Upper body: Minimal muscle mass (arms), underdeveloped anterior/posterior deltoids
- Lower body: Wide hip structure, underdeveloped gluteus maximus/medius, minimal
  quadriceps/hamstring development
- Regional adiposity: Hip dip presentation, lateral thigh adipose deposits (trochanteric region)
- Skeletal frame: Narrow thoracic cage, defined waist-to-hip ratio
- Subjective strength assessment: Below-average relative strength

## CURRENT TRAINING PROTOCOL

**Resistance Training** (frequency unspecified):

- Squats: 3 sets × 12 reps (bodyweight or load unspecified)
- Knee push-ups: 3 sets × 10 reps
- Fire hydrant (per leg): 3 sets × 15 reps
- Lunges: 2 sets × 10 reps (bilateral total or unilateral unclear)
- Glute bridges: 3 sets × 10 reps
- Cardiovascular finisher: 3 minutes (modality/intensity unspecified)

**Equipment Available**:

- Dumbbells: 2 kg (4.4 lbs) maximum load

**Training Gaps Identified**:

- No progressive overload protocol established
- Insufficient external load for hypertrophy stimulus
- Missing weekly training frequency data
- No periodization structure
- Unclear exercise tempo/time under tension parameters

## NUTRITIONAL CONTEXT

**Current Dietary Patterns**:

- Macronutrient balance: Self-reported balanced, tendency toward higher fat intake
- Food quality: 98% whole foods, <2% ultra-processed foods
- Variety: High dietary diversity reported
- Caloric surplus status: Likely insufficient given difficulty gaining weight
- Known aversions: Peanut butter (nut butter category)

**Metabolic Considerations**:

- Suspected high metabolic rate ( ic presentation)
- Poor weight gain response to current energy intake
- No data on: meal frequency, macronutrient partitioning, peri-workout nutrition, digestive capacity

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

**Target Body Composition**:

- Goal weight: 65 kg (+9 kg from baseline)
- Target timeline: Unspecified
- Composition priority: Lean mass accretion (aesthetic improvement focus)
- Motivational drivers: Body confidence enhancement, aesthetic outcomes (muscle definition, glute
  development, improved proportions)

**Risk Mitigation Requirements**:

- Avoid excessive fat gain during hypercaloric phase
- Maintain aesthetic improvements throughout progression
- Medical safety verification for underweight-to-normal weight transition

## CLIENT QUESTIONS REQUIRING PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT

### 1. Weight Gain Strategy Without Peanut Butter

**Query**: Design caloric surplus protocol achieving +9 kg lean mass gain while excluding peanut
butter and minimizing alternative nut butters if aversion extends beyond peanuts.

**Sub-requirements**:

- Identify calorie-dense whole food alternatives suitable for ic metabolism
- Structure macronutrient partitioning for muscle protein synthesis optimization
- Account for high metabolic rate and potential digestive limitations

### 2. Training Volume Sufficiency Analysis

**Query**: Evaluate whether current training volume (sets × reps × frequency) provides adequate
stimulus for hypertrophy and strength adaptation necessary to support +9 kg lean mass goal.

**Assessment criteria**:

- Weekly training frequency relative to muscle protein synthesis windows
- Set volume per muscle group against evidence-based hypertrophy benchmarks
- Load progression capacity with 2 kg equipment limitation

### 3. Body Composition Risk Assessment (Weight Gain Without Training Volume Increase)

**Query**: Quantify aesthetic and medical risks associated with +9 kg weight gain at current
training volume.

**Concerns**:

- Fat mass vs lean mass partitioning ratio without adequate training stimulus
- Potential negative aesthetic outcomes (disproportionate adipose deposition)
- Metabolic health implications of rapid weight gain in sedentary vs trained state
- Structural integrity (joint/tendon stress with untrained tissue mass increase)

### 4. Progressive Overload Equipment Requirements

**Query**: Determine threshold at which 2 kg dumbbells become insufficient for progressive overload,
and specify equipment progression roadmap (dumbbell weight increments, alternative loading
strategies, exercise modifications).

**Progression planning**:

- Timeline for outgrowing 2 kg loads based on novice strength adaptation curves
- Minimum equipment investment for sustained hypertrophy stimulus
- Bodyweight exercise progressions as alternative to external load increases
