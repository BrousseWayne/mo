I want to introduce an API to query ingredients and their macros/Micronutrients.

- This will introduce determinism. So every prompt will be Injected Real Data.
- We will able to cache/store them in our db and prepare grocery list/track our stock and many more to discover

Maybe think about pictures to track

We need to update the chef.
i think instead of recipe. It needs to follow a pattern: a carb/prot/fiber/vegetable.
It needs to know the basic cooking skills: non-exhaustive: sauter/braiser/frire/poeler
to be concise it needs to know the french techniques. It needs to know how to create a sauce, a broth/bouillon
It needs a bit of food science: handling temperatures, how fiber/prots/cellulose/etc handle heat
it needs to know the basic spice mix and ingredients for every popular cuisine(non exhaustive): ex: japan: shoyu/miso/garlic/ginger/sugar/pepper/msg/dashi / mexico: peppers/cilantro/cumin/oregano/avocado / france: butter/cream/dijon/cheese/herbes de provence etc...
We need to make it a full fledged cook.
