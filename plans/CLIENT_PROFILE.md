# TARGET CLIENT PROFILE

## Fixed & Locked Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Age | 28 years | Locked for all calculations |
| Height | 174 cm | |
| Current weight | 55-56 kg | Use 55 kg for initial calculations |
| BMI | ~18.5 | Borderline underweight (WHO classification) |
| **Target weight** | **65 kg (+9-10 kg total mass)** | |
| **Target composition** | **3-5 kg muscle + 5-7 kg healthy fat + 1-2 kg water/glycogen** | NOT lean mass only — she wants BOTH muscle AND fat |
| Target BMI | ~21.5 | Mid-healthy range |
| Training experience | Complete beginner (zero structured RT) | |
| Dietary constraints | None except peanut butter aversion | |
| Cooking resource | Experienced homecook partner available | Leverage for complex recipes and batch cooking |
| Children/pregnancy | None, no plans | Relevant for hormonal baselines |

## Physical Assessment

**Upper body**: Flat chest, very thin arms, no visible back musculature. Narrow frame appearance despite structural hip width.

**Lower body**: Wide hips, soft/fatty/ptotic glutes ("saggy — they jiggle"), absent hamstring development, hip dips, saddlebag fat (culotte de cheval).

**Pattern**: Undermuscled frame with selective gynoidal fat storage. NOT skinny-fat — it's a nearly empty muscular chassis with adipose tissue in estrogen-directed depots.

## Aesthetic Goals → Muscle Mapping

| Priority | Aesthetic Goal | Target Muscle(s) | Key Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ptotic glutes → round, projected | Gluteus maximus, hamstrings | Muscle scaffolding lifts existing adipose; new fat deposits on top of muscle = projection |
| 2 | Hip dips → filled lateral hip | Gluteus medius | Direct abduction work mandatory — squats/hip thrusts produce ZERO glute med growth (Plotkin 2023) |
| 3 | Very thin arms → proportional | Biceps, triceps, deltoids | Muscle gain + subcutaneous fat gain at these sites |
| 4 | Flat back → visible musculature | Lats, traps, rhomboids | Creates visual width to balance hip width |
| 5 | Overall mass → healthy filled-out look | Whole body | Both muscle AND fat — this is the distinguishing feature of this case |

## Cross-Cutting Client Constraints (All Agents Must Know)

| Constraint | Impact | Agents Affected |
|---|---|---|
| **Peanut butter and nut butter aversion** | Exclude from ALL recommendations. Substitutes: tahini, sunflower seed butter, coconut cream, avocado. | NUTRITIONIST, DIETITIAN, CHEF |
| **Complete beginner** | No assumed movement competency. All exercises need learning progression. RPE concept must be taught. | COACH |
| **Experienced homecook partner** | Complex recipes are feasible. Batch cooking for multiple days is realistic. Meal variety can be high. Partner can be accountability lever. | DIETITIAN, CHEF, (COACH for compliance) |
| **Likely under-eater** | Primary failure mode = not actually consuming target calories. All food-related agents must prioritize EASE of eating and calorie density over nutritional perfection. | NUTRITIONIST, DIETITIAN, CHEF |
| **Wants fat gain too** | Do NOT frame fat gain as a negative side effect. Frame it as a desired and healthy outcome at BMI 18.5. Address fat-gain anxiety proactively with estrogen distribution science. | ALL AGENTS |
