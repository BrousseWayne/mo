Knowledge Synthesis by Agent

MÉDECIN (Red #E63946) — LITE VERSION

Scope: Simple screening only, no deep medical analysis

Quick clearance checklist:

- BMI 18.5 = borderline underweight (The Lancet 2009)
- Basic red flags: amenorrhea >3 months, eating disorder history, persistent pain >1 week
- If any red flag → refer to real physician, STOP pipeline

NOT in scope: Blood panels, hormone analysis, detailed medical protocols

SCIENTIST (Blue #457B9D)

- Realistic gain: 0.25-0.5 kg/week
- Beginner women: ~0.23-0.45 kg muscle/month (McMaster 2025: 1kg lean mass/10 weeks)
- Roberts 2020: relative hypertrophy identical men/women (effect 0.07, p=0.31)
- NEAT: Levine 1999 - varies up to 2000 kcal/day, explains weight gain resistance
- Bouchard 1990: 100% of subjects gained weight under surplus (mean 8.1kg in 84 days)

Core knowledge:

- Morton 2018 (49 studies, 1863 participants): protein breakpoint at 1.62 g/kg
- Areta 2013: 4×20g every 3h > 2×40g or 8×10g for MPS
- Mamerow 2014: even distribution = +25% 24h MPS in women
- Res 2012: 40g casein pre-sleep = +22% overnight MPS

- Daily distribution: 5 meals (8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, 10:30pm)
- Protein per meal: 25-30g + 30-40g pre-sleep
- Known aversion: peanut butter → high-density alternatives
- Experienced homecook → leverage cuisine variety
- 400g chicken thighs/day = ~100g protein → supplement with other sources
- Strategies: drink AFTER meals, dense foods first, large plates

CHEF (Gold #E9C46A)

Core knowledge (GAP - needs research):

- Leverage multi-cuisine homecook skills
- High calorie-density recipes without peanut butter
- Batch cooking for 2 meals/day → 5 meals/day
- Homemade shake: banana + oats + whey + whole milk = 600-800 kcal
- Olive oil on everything (+100-200 kcal easy)
- Nuts, dried fruits, granola, full-fat dairy

COACH (Purple #9B5DE5)

Core knowledge:

- Schoenfeld 2016: ≥2x/week per muscle > 1x/week
- Volume: 10 sets/muscle/week start, Barbalho 2019: 5-10 sets = equal results to 15-20
- Refalo 2022: 1-3 RIR = same hypertrophy as failure, less fatigue
- Double progression: reach top of range → +2.5kg upper / +5kg lower
- Contreras 2015: hip thrust = 69-87% MVIC glute max vs 29-45% squat
- Plotkin 2023: gluteal hypertrophy similar hip thrust vs squat, BUT gluteus medius = 0 growth
  → abduction mandatory
- Schoenfeld 2018: mind-muscle connection = +12.4% biceps hypertrophy

- Cycle: volume ↑ follicular, recovery ↑ luteal (Colenso-Semple 2023: weak evidence but trend)
- Program: full body 3x/week months 1-4, upper/lower 4x months 5+

CROSS-CUTTING KNOWLEDGE (all agents)

Female physiology:

- Roberts 2020: relative hypertrophy = men (effect 0.07, p=0.31)
- Women GH = 3x men (Burman 2000)
- Estrogen = anabolic: +5% strength, +10% specific force (Lowe 2010)
- IGF-1 unique isoforms in women (Nindl 2019)
- Colenso-Semple 2024: circulating hormones neither sufficient nor necessary for MPS

Fat distribution:

- Pedersen 2004: estradiol → α2A antilipolytic receptors → gluteofemoral fat
- Steiner & Berry 2022: estrogen reduces visceral adipogenesis
- Implication: surplus = fat to hips/thighs/glutes, NOT abdomen

Supplementation (3 tiers):

- Tier 1: Creatine 3-5g/day (Kreider 2017: >680 trials, 12800+ participants), Vitamin D3
  2000-4000 IU, Magnesium glycinate 200-400mg
- Tier 2: Omega-3 2-4g (Smith 2011: MPS ×3), Ashwagandha KSM-66 300-600mg (cortisol -27.9%),
  Collagen 10-15g + vit C
- Tier 3: Zinc 15-30mg if deficient, HMB 3g

Sleep:

- Lamon 2021: 1 night deprivation → MPS -18%, cortisol +21%, testosterone -24%
- Born 1988: 70% GH in first slow-wave sleep cycle
- Target: 7-9h, ±30min consistency, 18-20°C bedroom

NEAT:

- Levine 2004: varies up to 2000 kcal/day
- Target: 5000-7000 steps/day max, cardio limited 1-2x 15-20min
- If no gain despite surplus → NEAT compensated → +200-300 kcal

Target Client Profile

- 28-year-old woman
- Difficulty gaining weight (56kg, 174cm, BMI ~18.5)
- Goal: +9kg lean mass gain to 65kg
- Aesthetic priority: muscle definition + soft attractive curves
- Beginner fitness level
- No children, no pregnancy plans
- Known aversion: peanut butter
- Experienced homecook (partner) available for meal prep

---

CRITICAL CORRECTIONS

1. The target is wrong
   The plan says "Goal: +9kg lean mass gain to 65kg." This is factually incorrect per our own research. The realistic breakdown we established is 3-5 kg muscle + 5-7 kg fat + 1-2 kg water/glycogen = ~10 kg total. She wants BOTH muscle AND fat — this was explicitly flagged as the distinguishing feature of her case ("a rare request that distinguishes her from the typical lean bulk crowd"). Writing "+9kg lean mass" contradicts the entire brief and will miscalibrate every agent downstream.
   Fix: "Goal: +9-10 kg total mass (3-5 kg muscle, 5-7 kg healthy fat, ~1-2 kg water/glycogen) to reach 65 kg."
2. You list 6 agents but say 5
   The Core Directives section says "5 agents" but then lists 6: MÉDECIN, SCIENTIFIQUE, NUTRITIONNISTE, DIÉTÉTICIEN, CHEF, COACH. The Final Deliverables section correctly says "6 persona files." Fix the count in Core Directives.
3. MÉDECIN scope is too thin
   The current MÉDECIN scope is basically a binary gate — red flag yes/no, then pass or stop. That's fine as a concept, but you're missing critical screening items specific to THIS client profile:

Energy availability screening: At BMI 18.5, the question isn't just "do you have amenorrhea" — it's whether she's in relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) territory even without being an athlete. The threshold is ~30 kcal/kg FFM/day (Mountjoy et al., 2018, IOC consensus).
Thyroid function flag: Chronic underweight suppresses T3. If she reports persistent cold extremities, hair loss, or fatigue, that's not a coach problem — it's a medical referral.
Bone density concern: Underweight young women have documented reduced BMD. Not something the agent diagnoses, but should flag for discussion with a real physician.
Mental health screen: The plan mentions eating disorder history as a red flag, but should also flag if she expresses intense anxiety about gaining fat, body dysmorphia patterns, or compulsive exercise — these can emerge DURING the protocol, not just at intake.

Fix: Expand the MÉDECIN checklist to include RED-S screening, thyroid red flags, bone density mention, and ongoing mental health monitoring triggers (not just intake screening). 4. SCIENTIST vs NUTRITIONIST — boundary is blurry
Currently, SCIENTIST handles "TDEE/macros calculations, baselines, metrics" and NUTRITIONIST handles "nutrition strategy, MPS, protein distribution, cycle." But macros ARE nutrition strategy. The overlap will create conflicts. Who owns the protein target — the SCIENTIST who calculated 1.6-2.0 g/kg, or the NUTRITIONIST who knows the MPS literature?
Recommended fix: SCIENTIST owns all calculations and baselines (BMR, TDEE, surplus magnitude, target weight trajectory, progress metrics, adjustment decision tree). NUTRITIONIST owns all qualitative nutrition strategy (what to eat, how to distribute it, MPS optimization, cycle-based adjustments, hardgainer strategies). The SCIENTIST says "you need 2,500 kcal with 100g protein." The NUTRITIONIST says "here's how to distribute those 100g across 5 meals to maximize MPS, and here's why liquid calories help you actually hit 2,500." 5. DIETITIAN vs CHEF — boundary is also blurry
You flag the DIETITIAN as "Partial" and CHEF as "Missing," but the real question is: what does the DIETITIAN do that the CHEF doesn't? Currently DIETITIAN = "concrete meal plan, substitutions" and CHEF = "recipes, batch cooking, gastronomy." A meal plan IS recipes. A recipe IS a concrete meal.
Recommended fix: The DIETITIAN is the architect — builds the weekly meal template hitting all macro/calorie targets, handles substitutions for aversions (peanut butter), manages variety/rotation to prevent boredom, adapts to constraints. The CHEF is the executor — takes each slot in the DIETITIAN's template and produces an actual, appetizing, technically sound recipe with quantities, steps, and batch-cooking integration. DIETITIAN says "Tuesday lunch: 30g protein, 60g carbs, 20g fat, no peanut butter, batch-cookable." CHEF says "Here's a Thai coconut chicken with rice, here's how to cook 4 portions at once." 6. The peanut butter aversion is noted but not propagated
It appears in the DIETITIAN section and the Target Client Profile, but isn't in the NUTRITIONIST's knowledge or the CHEF's. Since the NUTRITIONIST recommends "nut butters" as a calorie-dense strategy (from our knowledge base), there needs to be an explicit substitution rule that propagates across all food-related agents.
Fix: Add to cross-cutting knowledge: "Known aversion: peanut butter. Substitute with: almond butter, cashew butter, tahini, sunflower seed butter. All agents referencing nut butters must exclude peanut butter specifically."

STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS 7. The pipeline is too linear
The current pipeline is a strict waterfall: QUESTIONNAIRE → MÉDECIN → SCIENTIST → NUTRITIONIST → DIETITIAN → CHEF → COACH → OUTPUT. This works for initial plan generation, but real coaching is iterative. What happens when:

The COACH prescribes training that the SCIENTIST needs to account for in TDEE recalculation?
The DIETITIAN discovers the client can't eat 5 meals/day due to work schedule — does this go back to the NUTRITIONIST?
Week 4 weigh-in shows 0.1 kg/week gain — who triggers the adjustment, and who recalculates?

Recommendation: Add a feedback loop layer to the pipeline. After initial generation, define a monitoring/adjustment cycle where the SCIENTIST re-evaluates metrics weekly, and any agent can flag an issue that triggers a recalculation cascade. The INTER_AGENTS document should define these feedback paths explicitly. 8. Missing: ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL per agent
Our knowledge base has a detailed adjustment decision tree (Section 11.2). But the plan doesn't specify which agent owns which adjustment. When the weekly average shows <0.25 kg/week gain for 2 weeks:

Who detects it? (SCIENTIST, via metrics monitoring)
Who diagnoses? (NUTRITIONIST checks if intake was actually hit; COACH checks if NEAT increased)
Who prescribes? (SCIENTIST recalculates; DIETITIAN adjusts meal plan; CHEF adjusts recipes)

Fix: Add an "Adjustment Ownership Matrix" to INTER_AGENTS. 9. Missing: PHASE TRANSITIONS
The plan mentions "full body 3x/week months 1-4, upper/lower 4x months 5+" in the COACH section, but there's no protocol for WHEN and HOW the transition happens. What triggers the phase change? Stagnation on lifts? Time elapsed? A specific strength benchmark?
Our knowledge base says "transition when full-body progress stalls," but that's vague for an agent. Define concrete transition criteria:

3+ consecutive sessions with no progression on ≥2 compound lifts, despite adequate sleep/nutrition
OR minimum 16 weeks completed on current program
OR subject requests more training frequency

10. The Conflict Resolution Protocol is flagged but empty
    The plan says "Inter-agents - Not formalized: Conflict resolution protocol." This is critical. Example conflicts that WILL arise:

NUTRITIONIST says "eat more" but MÉDECIN flags rapid weight gain as concerning
COACH says "train harder" but SCIENTIST says recovery metrics are poor
CHEF proposes a recipe that the DIETITIAN rejects because macros don't fit
DIETITIAN prescribes a food the client dislikes (not flagged at intake)

Recommendation: Define a simple hierarchy — MÉDECIN always overrides all others on health flags. SCIENTIST overrides on metrics/calculations. NUTRITIONIST overrides DIETITIAN/CHEF on strategy. COACH is autonomous on training but defers to SCIENTIST on recovery metrics.

MINOR ISSUES 11. Agent names — mixed languages
You have MÉDECIN and CHEF (French) alongside SCIENTIST, NUTRITIONIST, DIETITIAN, COACH (English). Since all output is in English per directive, consider standardizing the agent names to English: PHYSICIAN, SCIENTIST, NUTRITIONIST, DIETITIAN, CHEF, COACH. Or keep all French. The mix is confusing for a system prompt. 12. The age changed
The original brief says "27+" but the Target Client Profile says "28-year-old." Minor, but for TDEE calculations it matters slightly. Pick one and lock it. 13. Lexicon scope is underspecified
The plan says "Consolidate terminology from references" but doesn't define what the lexicon IS for. Is it: (a) a glossary for the USER so the agents can explain terms? (b) a standardized vocabulary for INTER-AGENT communication so they use the same words? (c) a mapping of banned terms → correct terms? Probably all three, but specify. 14. The "partner" variable is under-exploited
The Target Client Profile mentions "Experienced homecook (partner) available for meal prep." This is a massive practical advantage that only the CHEF section touches. The DIETITIAN should account for it (meal plans can be more complex because someone skilled is cooking), the NUTRITIONIST should leverage it (complex meal timing is feasible), and the COACH could even flag "partner accountability" as a compliance lever.

WHAT'S EXCELLENT
To be clear — the bones of this plan are strong:

The scientific rigor directive with banned terminology and required references is exactly right. This prevents the most common failure mode in fitness AI (parroting bro-science).
The tiered supplementation directly from our knowledge base is well-integrated.
The color-coding per agent will make visual output clean.
The coverage audit (which agents are complete vs gaps) is honest and useful.
The cross-cutting knowledge section ensures all agents share the same foundational science.
The execution pipeline logic is correct even if it needs the feedback loop addition.

RECOMMENDED PRIORITY ORDER FOR FIXES

Fix the "+9kg lean mass" error → "+9-10 kg total mass" (this miscalibrates everything)
Clarify SCIENTIST vs NUTRITIONIST boundary (prevents conflicts)
Clarify DIETITIAN vs CHEF boundary (prevents duplication)
Expand MÉDECIN screening checklist
Add feedback loop + adjustment ownership matrix to INTER_AGENTS
Define phase transition criteria for COACH
Propagate peanut butter aversion across all food-related agents
Standardize agent naming language
Define conflict resolution hierarchy
Then proceed to Phase 1 (CHEF research) and Phase 2 (persona creation)
